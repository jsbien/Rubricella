\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The goal of the paper is twofold.  One goal is to present a minor
  contribution to the task of describing the character inventory of a
  16th century Polish printing house; for this purpose it is necessary
  to present also some theoretical aspects of the task. Another one is
  to discuss the use of \XeLaTeX{} and other tools in the author's
  workflow.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The idea to create the inventory of characters for Polish early
printing houses dates back to 1920\footnote{ It is worth noting that
  independently the idea of some kind of an inventory is proposed
  independently from time to time, cf. e.g.  cf. \cite{Cassetin2003}.}.
It was proposed by Ludwik
Bernacki \cite{bernacki20:_monum}, the inspiration came probably from
Konrad Haebler's \textit{Typenrepertorium der Wiegendrucke} which
started to appear in
1905\footnote{Cf. e.g. \tbsurl{tw.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/}}.

The 12 volumes of the series entitled \textit{Polonia Typographica
  Saeculi Sedecim} published in 1936-1981 were an attempt to implement
this postulate. According to
\cite{johnson65:_polon_typog_saecul_sedec} the layout of the tables
followed the publications of \textit{Geselshaft für
  Typenkunde}\footnote{Cf. \tbsurl{worldcat.org/identities/nc-gesellschaft
    fur typenkunde des xv jahrhunderts berlin/}}.  Since the volume
III the fonts were documented not only with text samples, but also
with the tables of characters,
cf. Fig. \ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112}; reportedly they have been
created by cutting with a razor blade the characters from the
photocopies and pasting them together.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{imgR/Ungler1_pismo01_tab112}
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\hsize]{imgR/Ungler1_pismo01_tab112}
  \caption{\textit{Polonia Typographica III} %
    (\cite{bułhak:_pierw_florian_ungler1}), fragment of plate
    112: font number 1}
  \label{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112}
\end{figure}

With the exception of the small samples included in the publications
(probably photozincography was used), the authors of the series worked
with original prints. In the meantime many of those prints has been
digitized and are available on the Internet. Hence it is possible to
confront the character sets provided in \textit{Polonia Typographica}
with the texts which are supposed to use them. The first (and for the
time being the only one) such attempt, described in
\cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog}, concerned so called font (in
Polish paleotypographical terminology \textit{pismo}) number 1 of Florian
Ungler’s first printing shop (1510–1516). It revealed some surprising
discrepancies.

According to the edytor of the 3th volume of \textit{Polonia
  Typographica} \cite{bułhak:_pierw_florian_ungler1}, the font in
question was used only in 3 publications\footnote{I take this claim
  for granted, but it would be nice to verify it with some computer
  tool.}, all of them digitized by now:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  \textit{Algorithmus} [\ldots] by Sacro Bosco (1511):
\cite{sacro11:_algor_ioann_de_sacro_busto},
\item \textit{Almanach ad a. 1511} by Aurifaber:
 \cite{cracoviensis11:_alman}, 
\item \textit{Rubricella
  dioecesis Cracoviensis ad a. 1511} (author unknown):
\cite{nieznany10:_rubric_cracov}. 
\end{enumerate}

We will focus here on the third item, see Fig. \ref{fig:Rubr} (the
page format is \textit{plano}, I don't know the exact size) which was
used in \cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog} in a very limited way.

 \begin{figure*}

   \caption{\textit{Rubricella
  dioecesis Cracoviensis ad a. 1511}}
   \label{fig:Rubr}
 \end{figure*}

 The print quality is low, the font is worn out, so for many letter
 the impression of the type face is not complete or distorted in some
 other way. Unfortunately there is no information about the earlier
 uses of the font (Ungler came to Poland from Bavaria).

\section{Typemes}
\label{sec:typemes-1}
It is far from clear what are the basic units of texts (and how they
should be called),
especially when working with old texts.

To account for different user needs in
\cite[p. 22]{robinson06:_guidel_trans_manus_wife_baths_prolog} four
levels of transciptions has been identified: graphic, graphetic,
graphemic and regularized. A different classification is used e.g.  in
\cite[p. 4]{romein_c_annemieke_2022_7267245} which, for so called
Ground-Truth texts, distinguishes diplomatic\footnote{The adjective is
  derived from \textit{diplomatics}
  (\tbsurl{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatics}), not
  \textit{diplomacy}.}, semi-diplomatic and hyper-diplomatic
transcriptions.  Actually talking about transcription levels is not
precise, there is a whole multi-dimensional space of transcriptions
differing in independent aspects of editing (e.g. are ligatures
preserved? are abbreviation marks resolved? are misprints corrected?).

Our primary goal is the ``typemic'' transcription, representing a text
as a sequence of typemes in the sense of Jacques André.  He introduced
the notion of typeme (in French \textit{typème}) in
\cite{typemes2022}) and discussed later in
\cite{andre:halshs-00983575} where the notion of typemic transcription
was additionally introduced. Specific typemes are listed in several
draft technical notes by André available at
\tbsurl{jacques-andre.fr/PICA/}. The most recent one
\cite{andré22:_inven_unicod_mufi} lists 1172 typemes. The typeme is
described as the `character casted' considered regardless the design
and size, in other words the typemes are the glyphs of characters
present in the [metal]
typefaces\footnote{Cf. \cite[p. 4]{andré22:_inven_unicod_mufi}:
  \textit{«caractère fondu» mais sans tenir compte ni du dessin, ni de
    la taille des caractères. On peut dire que ce sont les glyphes des
    caractères présents dans les polices de caractères au sens
    original d’inventaire (décompte des sortes)}. BTW, the notion of
  typeme in other meaning has been used by a Swedish linguist Göran
  Hammarström, but this is not relevant to our purposes.}.

In other words, we want to represent precisely the print types/sorts
of the text transcribed.

The typemes are
assigned the code points of the Unicode characters if appropriate ones
exist, sometimes in the case of polisemic glyphs
(cf. \cite[p. 129]{andre:halshs-00983575}) in an arbitrary way.

Usually it is not sufficient to provide users with only one type of
transcription. If document is available on a server, then usually the
server software allows to switch between various transcription. It is
however desirable to have a similar option for a downloaded document
on a local computer. Theoretically PDF can be used for this, as
multiple layers of text are allowed e.g. for engineering and other
application. An example of a diferent idea for presenting multiple
aspects of old texts in a single PDF document is discussed in
\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-91669-5_5}.  It might be useful to use in DjVu
documents the hidden text layer for the typemic transciption and the
annotations to provide another version of the transcription, but this
is outside the scope of this paper.

\section{Workflow}
\label{sec:workflow}


\subsection{The sources}
\label{sec:sources}

Latin \textit{rubricella} (in Polish
\textit{rubrycela}\footnote{Cf. e.g. \tbsurl{pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubrycela}})
is another name of \textit{Directorium Divini
  Officii}\footnote{Cf. e.g. \tbsurl{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorium}}
or \textit{Ordo Divini Officii}; the rubricella discussed here have a
very simple form.

In the digital library the rubricella is accompanied by 3 pages of a
typewritten text reconstructing the fragments missing (the page has
been trimmed) or damaged; the reconstruction was based on another
rubricella for this year printed by another printer, namely Jan
(Johann) Haller, and preserved in Jagiellonian Library as
\textit{Cim. vol. 4}.  It is not digitized, but Jacek Patryka, the
head of Old Prints Section, kindly provided me with a high quality
photo.

The reconstruction was not based directly on Haller's rubricella, but
on ``Sawicki's copy''. At first this remark was unclear for me, but
later Mark Thakkar on the Facebook group of \textit{The Paleography
  Society} pointed to me Sawicki's book
(\cite{sawicki45:_statut_jana_konar}), which contains the full text of
Haller's rubricella (following the common editorial practise almost
all abbreviations has been resolved and expanded).

Although the content of the rubricella is in principle not relevant to
the character inventory, I confronted the sources creating a
parallel text: Haller's rubricella Sawicki's transcription,
reconstructed Ungler's rubricella transcription, original Ungler
rubricella typemic transcription, cf. Fig. \ref{fig:RubrParallel}. It
allowed in particular to resove some non-obvious abbreviations. On the
other hand the parallel text revealed some strange discrepancies, but
this is outside the scope of this paper.

 \begin{figure*}

   \caption{The parallel text of the rubricella versions}
% /home/jsbien/git/repertuarXVI/Rubricella/Rubricella_parallel.pdf
   \label{fig:RubrParallel}
 \end{figure*}

 The parallel text was typeset with
 \texttt{expex}\footnote{\tbsurl{/www.ctan.org/pkg/expex}} by John
 Frampton; according to its author's description \textit{The package
   provides macros for typesetting linguistic examples and glosses,
   with a refined mechanism for referencing examples and parts of
   examples}. The name is derived from the names of the two basic
 command \verb+\ex+ i \verb+pex+, which in turn are abbreviations of
 \textit{example} i \textit{parts example}).

\subsection{Image preprocessing}
\label{sec:image-preprocessing}

Working with a page in the \textit{plano} format would be cumbersome
even on a large display, so I decided to split the page into 5 parts
in the reading order: the initial single column text, the left narrow
column, the left half-page column, the right narrow column, the right
half-page column. The digital library provides the document in the
DjVu format (once very popular\footnote{To make a long story short,
  the original reasons for creating it are no longer valid, but it is
  still the best format for some purposes, cf. eg. \cite{bc71}.})
but there are no tools for such editing in this format.
Hence the document was exported as a graphic file with
\textsf{djview}\footnote{\tbsurl{djvu.sourceforge.net/djview4.html}}
and split into PNG files with
Gimp\footnote{\tbsurl{www.gimp.org/}}.

The transcription process described below for unknown reason degrades
the scan quality. Therefore they were also converted to a DjVu
document with the \textsf{didjvu} program. The program has been
written by Jakub Wilk, who no longer maintaines it, in Python 2. I am
using now Friedric Foebel's Python 3
fork\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/FriedrichFroebel/didjvu}}.


\subsection{The transcription}
\label{sec:transcription}

For transcription the so called Expert Client to the Transkribus
system\footnote{Cf. \tbsurl{readcoop.eu/transkribus/}. The Expert
  Client is no longer supported as it has been phased out by a Web
  interface. The formal status of the system is complicated. Some
  tools are Open Source and free,
  cf. \tbsurl{github.com/Transkribus/}, the use of some other
  tools is charged per page.} has been used,
cf. Fig. \ref{fig:Trans}.

It is worth mentioning that the Optical Character Recognition,
understood literally, is no longer in use. It was replaced by neural
network tools, usually named Handwritten Text Recogniton (HTR), which
operate on the whole lines of texts. Although the results of HTR are
often quite impressive, the segmentation into characters and even
words is not needed for these algorithms, so looks like the tools for
such detailed segmentations are no longer developed and are not
available easily, at least I din't find any such tool appropriate for
my goals\footnote{In particular \prname{Glyph Miner}
  (\tbsurl{https://github.com/benedikt-budig/glyph-miner/}) seemed
  quite promising, but its use appeared prohibitively difficult,
  primarily because of the lack of sufficient documentation,
  cf. e.g. \tbsurl{https://github.com/benedikt-budig/glyph-miner/discussions/14}.}.

The images created with Gimp and uploaded to Transkribus has been
segmented into text lines automatically, but the low quality of the
print confused the algorithm quite often, so extensive manual
corrections were needed\footnote{For the reasons mentioned,
  Transkribus does not provide a tool for an automatic word
  segmentation. It is possible to do it by hand, but it is rather
  cumbersome, so I preferred to defer this operation to a later stage
  of the workflow.}.


 \begin{figure*}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{imgR/Transkribus}
   \caption{The transcription window of Transkribus Expert Client}
   \label{fig:Trans}
 \end{figure*}


 In the transcription I use \Ssgl{⧺} (\ucode{29FA} \uname{DOUBLE
   PLUS}) to mark a missing beginning or ending of a word, and
 \Ssgl{⋯} (\ucode{22EF} \uname{MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS}) to mark a
 whole missing word. Moreover I use \Ssgl{⚠} (\ucode{26A0}
 \uname{WARNING SIGN}) to mark fragments which require special
 attention. I use also \Ssgl{�} \ucode{FFFD} \uname{REPLACEMENT
   CHARACTER} for illegible characters.

I didn't aim at the perfect transcription, it is sometimes good to
 delay some decisions to a later stage.

 Transkribus allows to export the transcription in several formats,
 the ultimate format for me is the DjVu format mentioned earlier.

 I quite often exported a PDF file, with the \textit{images plus text
   layer} option selected, until I encountered a problem with the no
 longer maintained Jakub Wilk's \textsf{pdf2djvu}
 program\footnote{Cf. \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/pdf2djvu/issues/1}}.

 So this time I decided to export the transcription in the ALTO format
 (\textit{Analyzed Layout and Text
   Object})\footnote{Cf. e.g. \tbsurl{www.loc.gov/standards/alto/}}
with the option \textit{Split Lines Into Words}.

It should be noted that recognizing words in old prints without
understanding the text or using a dictionary is close to impossible
because of the inconsistent use of the horizontal
(interword/interletter) spaces. I don't know what algorithm is used by
the ALTO export but the results, at least for \textit{Rubricella},
were unfortunately not satisfactory and required manual adjustment,
which was done during the indexing phase.


 The ALTO files (one file for every page) are converted first to
 \textit{hOCR} (\cite{BREU2007}) with \textsf{ocr-transform}
 tool\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/UB-Mannheim/ocr-fileformat}}.

 The next step was using the \textsf{html2djvused} program. Originally
 written by Jakub Wilk in Python 2 and distributed with
 \textsf{ocrodjvu}\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/jwilk-archive/ocrodjvu}}
 is no longer maintained by him; several forks exist with more or less
 complete conversion to Python 3, I used one of
 them\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/rockclimb/hocr2djvused}}.  As
 the name suggest, the output of \textsf{html2djvused} was used by
 \textsf{djvused}, one of the tools of the DjVuLibre
 library\footnote{\tbsurl{djvu.sourceforge.net/}}, to import the
 transcription as the hidden text layer into the DjVu document
 mentioned earlier in section \ref{sec:image-preprocessing}.

 Last but not least, the basic metadata has been inserted into the
 document, providing in particular the link to the digital library
 containing the original version.  This is the very document which is
 used in the later stages of the workflow. 

 
 \subsection{Indexing and annotating}
\label{sec:indexing-annotating}

The next step in the workflow used intensively the
\textsf{djview4poliqarp}
program\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/djview-poliqarp_fork}}
(designed by myself and programmed by Michał Rudolf).  At first it was
just a fork of \textsf{djview} intended to facilitate the use of DjVu
corpora, %\cite{bc177},
cf. e.g. \cite{bc381}.
Later the program has been extended to create and browse simple
indexes to DjVu
documents\footnote{Cf. e.g. \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/iLindeCSV},
  \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/Zaborowski-index4djview}}.

From the technical point of view the indexes are just simple CSV
files (with the semicolon as the separator). 
  
Every line of an index file consists of three or four fields:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The entry used for sorting and incremental search.
\item The reference to the relevant image fragment in the form used by
  \textsf{djview4} viewer mentioned earlier, namely an Universal
  Resource Locator. Some fully-fledged examples can be found e.g. in
  the indexes to Linde's dictionary, in particular in the tiny index
  of the planet
  symbols\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/iLindeCSV/blob/master/Linde-znaki/planety.csv}}.
  In the indexes discussed here the scheme and authority parts are
  absent, and the path is limited to the file names; this means in
  practise that \prname{djview4poliqarp} has to be called with the
  index directory as the default one. The fragment part is also
  missing, and the query part contains the dimensions and the
  coordinates of the image fragment in the \textsf{djview4} specific
  form;
  it can contain also the specification of a
  color used for highlighting. The referenced image fragment has to be
  rectangular, but a single URL can reference several such fragments.
\item A description: a text displayed for the current entry in a small
  window under the index.
\item An optional comment displayed after the entry; we proceed it by
  ※ (\ucode{203B} \uname{REFERENCE MARK}) for a more distinctive
  display. It was absent in the first versions of the program and was
  added later, primarily to distinguish homographs.
\end{enumerate}

The initial index is created by a quick-and-dirty modification of the
already mentioned \prname{djvused} program\footnote{I keep it in a
  private repository \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/djvused4indexes} as I
  hope to replace it by something more elegant which I will make
  public. Some help would be greatly appreciated.}. Here is an example
of a line created by the program for Rubricella, it is composed from
the following fields (below split into several lines for editorial
reasons):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \sgl{ↄꝺuctus} (the entry),
\item \verb|file:Rubricela_1511_Unglera.djvu?|\break
  \verb|djvuopts=&page=0003|\break
  \verb|&highlight=0237,2075,0117,0019| (the URL without color
  specification, as we use a rudimentary form of the path, the file
  has to be present in the current directory),
\item \verb|Rubricela_1511_Unglera.djvu| p=3 l=19 tl=258 w=39 tw=530
  (the description: the file name, the page number, the line number on
  the page, the line number in the document, the word
  number on the page, the word number in the document; especially
  useful when several indexes are merged),
\item ※ \sgl{ↄꝺuctus} (the comment, initially equal to the entry but
  prefixed by ※ for the reason mentioned earlier, usually somehow
  edited later to contain the transcription, e.g.
  \textit{conductus}).
\end{enumerate}

 \begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{imgR/Rubricella1}
   \caption{The incorrect bounding box of an original index entry}
   \label{fig:Trans2}
 \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{imgR/Rubricella2}
   \caption{The manually corrected bounding box of the entry}
   \label{fig:Trans3}
 \end{figure}
 
 The index, besides being browsed with \prname{djview4poliqarp}
 program, has also other applications, e.g. a simple \prname{sed}
 script
 creates a secondary index where the comments are entries and
 \textit{vice versa}\footnote{Cf. the \prname{sed} directory at
   \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/Zaborowski-index4djview}.}.

 Using \prname{djview4poliqarp} I corrected by hand the borders of
 practically all 1638 words of \textit{Rubricella},
 cf. Fig. \ref{fig:Trans2} and \ref{fig:Trans3}. It would be nice to
 incorporate the changes into the hidden text layer. It can be done
 with a very simple program which is however yet to be written.
 
 To double-check the index it good to make a histogram of all the
 characters occuring in the text. I usually used for it
 \prname{unihistext}\footnote{cf. \tbsurl{https://github.com/jsbien/unihistext}},
 a fork of Bill Poser's \prname{unihist}, implemented some time ago by
 a student of mine following my suggestions, which provided the names
 for the Unicode and some private characters and their combining sequences. Unfortunately it was
 written in Python 2 and its adaptation to Python 3 does not seem
 trivial. Hence now I have to use the original \prname{unihist}.


 It should be noted that it is very easy to create various specialised
 subindexes by extracting the relevant lines of the CSV file with
 e.g. \prname{grep}. For this purpose some special tags can be added
 to selected fields (with \prname{djview4poliqarp} or a favourite text
 or spreadsheet editor). Such subindexes can be used in particular for
 snippet extraction described below.
 
\subsection{Snippets extraction}
\label{sec:snippets-extraction}
The main tool for snippet extraction is \prname{ddjvu}, the calls to
\prname{ddjvu} are generated by a \prname{sed} script,
cf. Fig~\ref{sed1} and \ref{sed1example}.  Please note that the
graphic snippet file name incorporates the information about its
origin. I consider this very useful, but unfortunately due to a not
yet fixed bug there are not alway reliable.

\end{verbatim}
\caption{A graphic snippet example}
\label{sed1example}
\end{figure*}

To allow for including the snippets in a \LaTeX{} source we convert them to the \prname{png}, cf. Fig.~\ref{convert}.

that the entry field is preserved as the comment, cf Fig.~\ref{sed2example}.

\section{The inventory}
\label{sec:inventory}

The inventory is presented using the \prname{expex} package mentioned
earlier. The first line contains the graphic snippets, and the second
the subsequent numbers for reference purposes. The third line contains
the typemic transcription typeset with Junicode Two font, and the last
one contains a kind of high level transcription for which I don't have
a name yet. I apply the following rules, roughly in the order listed.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ligatures are split into the component letters, e.g. \Ju{}
  becomes \Ju{ſi} and \Ju{ĳ} becomes \Ju{ij}, which may be subject to
  further processing, e.g. \Ju{ſi} becomes \Ju{si} and \Ju{ij} becomes
  \Ju{ii} (there was/is no letter \Ju{j} in
  Latin\footnote{Cf. e.g. \tbsurl{medium.com/in-medias-res/theres-no-j-in-latin-your-holiness-5a331c3f7a06}};
  nevertheless \Ju{j} was/is used in the so called Ramist
  forms\footnote{The name comes from Pierre de la Ramée (Petrus
    Ramus),
    c.f. \tbsurl{www.stmarys-parish.org/Latin/LatinSpelling.htm}.}).
\item Obsolete letters (or rather obsolete letter shapes) are replaced
  by their modern equivalents, e.g. \Ju{ſ} becomes \Ju{s} and \Ju{ꝺ}
  becomes \Ju{d}.
\item Ambiguities of \Ju{u} and \Ju{i} are resolved and replaced by
  the Ramist forms, i.e. when appropriate \Ju{u} is replaced by \Ju{v}
  and \Ju{i} by \Ju{j}\footnote{Reportedly
    \tbsurl{alatius.com/macronizer/} should be able to do it
    automatically.}, e.g. \Ju{Aue} becomes \Ju{Ave}.
\item Brevigraphs\footnote{The term is used by me in a narrow sense to
    refer to a scribal abbreviation in the form of a single
    character.} are resolved, in most cases the meaning of them is
  obvious, however sometimes understanding the context is needed, e.g.
  isolated \Ju{ꝑ} becomes \Ju{per} and \Ju{ꝑmanente} becomes
  \Ju{permanente} but \Ju{coꝛꝑe} becomes \Ju{corpore}.
\item Other abbreviations are resolved what sometimes may require good
  understanding the context, e.g \Ju{an̄e} means here \Ju{ antiphonae}
  but it is far from obvious; moreover there are special rules for
  \textit{nomina sacra}, see below.
\item Letter case is adjusted to be compatible with modern spelling.
\item Obvious mistakes are noted and corrected.
\end{enumerate}
The rules describe the transcription of single words, for multiword
texts additional rules are needed for marking the proper segmentation,
but we won't use them here.

This transcription for clarity is provided only when it differs from
the typemic transcription.

The typemic transcription uses the default character glyphs, which can
be sometimes quite different from the original. In some fonts a better
approximation of the shape can be achieved using OpenType features,
e.g. in Junicode \Ju{ꝉ} can be rendered as with \Ju{󰀏} using
\verb|cv17| (\verb|cv| stands for character variant). 


\subsection{Some problems of typemic transcription}
\label{sec:some-probl-typem}


Peter Robinson\footnote{\tbsurl{artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/PRobinson}},
the editor of the manuscripts of Geoffrey Chaucer, wrote
\cite[p. 186--187]{robinson16:_digit_revol_schol_editin}
\textit{scribes, over and over, don’t seem to care whether the two
  minims\footnote{Wikipedia (\tbsurl{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(palaeography)})
    states: \textit{A minim is the basic stroke for the letters i, m,
      n, and u in uncial script and later scripts deriving from it};
    the limitation to specific scripts does not seem necessary.} are
  joined at the top (as in a modern printed n; [\ldots]%
) or joined at the bottom (as in a
modern printed u; [\ldots]%
), or not joined at all.
And then, what we call a macron takes
a bewildering variety of forms. Sometimes it is indeed a single straight
stroke over the letter. Sometimes it extends over several letters. Often
it is curved. And very often it appears as a loop, beginning at the base
of the last minim and arching back over the two minims of the u/n
character and preceding letters. Attempting to devise transcription
protocols in these circumstances is a complex dance with a collection
of hydra. The intentions of the scribes appear increasingly opaque and
distant, and we are left searching our own intentions. Exactly what
are we trying to record; for who; and why?}.

To my surprise the problem with minims occurs also in
\textit{Rubricella}, as illustrated below.

Sometimes \Ju{n} is used instead of \Ju{u}, cf. example (8) and
\textit{vice versa}, cf. examples (2) and (7). Sometimes \Ju{m} is
used in place of \Ju{in} or \Ju{ni}, cf. example (1) and (3), and
sometimes \Ju{un} is used as \Ju{im}, cf. example (6).  However the
most intriguing are the fragments where \Ju{m}, \Ju{n} and \Ju{u} look
just like a sequence of dotless \textit{{i}}, cf. examples (4) and
(9). I have no idea whether this is an effect of the type being worn
up, or whether it is an intentional use of the dotless \textit{i}. In
consequence it is not clear what should be the typemic representation
of such fragments. For the time being I have no answer to this
question. I don't know also whether this phenomenon occurs also in
other prints of that time.

On the other hand the various shapes of the overline abbreviation mark
definitely appear also in this and other publications, cf. some
examples below. All of them are encoded, at least for the time being,
just as a macron (in Unicode \Ju{◌¯} \ucode{00AF} \uname{MACRON}).
% , cf. e.g. \cite{bień21:_trakt_stanis_zabor}.

Another problem worth mentioning concerns the variants of letter
\textit{i}. There is no doubt that \Ju{ī} (in Unicode \ucode{012B}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH MACRON}) is an abbreviation, but the
dotless \textit{i}\footnote{By the way, this is the primary form of
  the letter; the dot, called technically a tittle, appeared in the
  Middle Ages, cf. e.g.
  \tbsurl{www.quora.com/Why-do-“i”-and-“j”-posses-a-dot}.},
the standard \textit{i} with dot and \textit{i} with acute seem to be
used in the same function; when there is no doubt about the shape
there are encoded respectively as \Ju{ı} \ucode{0131} \uname{LATIN
  SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I}, \Ju{i} \ucode{0069} \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LETTER I} and \Ju{í} \ucode{00ED} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH
  ACUTE}.

In some cases \Ju{c} in used instead of \Ju{e}, cf. the examples
below:

{\Junicode
\exdisplay
\bg
\gla    
\includegraphics[height=3ex]{snippets/snippet_RubricellaUnglerTrJSB_page5x831y1220} % diei

\glUnicode

It is not clear whether they are just mistakes or intentional
replacements due to some technical limitations.

\subsection{Minuscules}
\label{sec:minuscules}
Fig. \ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} lists minuscules, their
ligatures and brevigraphs in one sequence, we prefer to describe them
separately. For most of the minuscules the Unicode encoding is
obvious.

Some minuscules are supplemented by an abbreviation mark, usually more
or less horizontal line over the letter, encoded conventionally as
macron. Sometimes the mark resemble a tilde, cf. example (57), % ꝺn̈ıcā
or a
flattened circumflex, cf. example (50). % ⁊c̄
Sometimes the abbreviation is
marked by a diaresis, cf. example (46). % 
Sometimes the bar is so short that looks like a dot, cf. example
(58) %
The most intriguing is the abbreviation mark in example (60).Is this
just a diaresis? Or a little known character \uname{COMBINING LATIN
  SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} proposed by Medieval Unicode
Font
Initiative\footnote{\tbsurl{mufi.info/q.php?p=mufi/chars/unichar/7635}}?
Or something else?  I don't know the definite answer, but Susana
Tavares Pedro supported my hypothesis on the Facebook The Paleography
Society
group\footnote{\tbsurl{www.facebook.com/groups/7687162686/permalink/10159164467367687}}.
On the other hand on the figure \ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} the
diacritical mark over \textit{s} looks rather as a macron.

It is interesting to compare the letter \textit{l} in the examples (4)
and e.g. (15). Is this the same type from the same font? I'm not sure.

A reader may be curious what the letter \Ju{Ʒ}, which usually is just
the equivalent of \Ju{z}, is doing in the abbreviation of
\Ju{capitulum}. This is an example of a homographic character, it
should be interpreted at some level of transcription as Unicode
\ucode{A76B} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER ET} (in Junicode \Ju{ꝫ}).  The
scribes used to write \Ju{m} vertically to save the space, the letter
written this way looked as \Ju{ꝫ}, so one of its meaning is just
\Ju{m}.

A reader may be also curious what \Ju{x} and \Ju{p} are doing in an
abbreviation of \Ju{Christi}. The answer is that \Ju{x} stands for the
Greek \textit{chi}, and \Ju{p} for the Greek \textit{rho}.  This is just
an example of the special abbreviation rules for \textit{nomina
  sancta}.

\subsection{Ligatures}
\label{sec:ligatures}

Besides the ligatures classified here as brevigraphs and discussed
below, the fig. \ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} lists only \Ju{ﬀ}
(\ucode{FB00} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF}). Actually in the text
we can see also \Ju{ﬅ} (\ucode{FB05} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE LONG
  S T}), cf. example (5), \Ju{} (\mcode{EBA3}\footnote{Using the M
  prefix for the characters from the recommendation of Medieval
  Unicode Font Initiative was proposed by me in \cite{bc480}; I've
  spotted this convention used independently elsewhere, unfortunately
  I don't remember where.} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE LONG S L [MUFI
  4.0]}), cf. example (29) and \Ju{} (\mcode{EBA2} \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LIGATURE LONG S I [MUFI 4.0]}), cf. example (39).

The ligature \Ju{ĳ} (\ucode{0133} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE IJ}),
cf. example (10), is just a variant of \Ju{ii}, as it was already
mentioned.

\subsection{Brevigraphs}
\label{sec:brevigraphs}



Some popular brevigraphs occured already in the examples above, namely
\Ju{⁊} (in Unicode \ucode{204A} \uname{TIRONIAN SIGN ET}, in Junicode
font also \Ju{󰀝}), cf. example (50), \Ju{ꝉ} (in Unicode \ucode{A749}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH HIGH STROKE}, in Junicode font also
\Ju{󰀏}), which occurs with different meanings in the examples (52),
(53) and (54), \Ju{ꝝ} (in Unicode \ucode{A75D} \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LETTER RUM ROTUNDA}), cf. example (53).


I prefer to classify the character encoded here as \Ju{h̵}\footnote{Its
  shape can be also approximated by \Ju{} (\mcode{E8A3} \uname{LATIN ABBREVIATION SIGN AUTEM [MUFI 4.0]}).}
 (in Unicode
\ucode{0068} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER H} followed by \ucode{0335}
\uname{COMBINING SHORT STROKE OVERLAY}), in Junicode font also
\Ju{\addfontfeatures{CharacterVariant=16:0}h̵}\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/134}},
cf. example (51), as a brevigraph, but the diacritic can be used also
with some other letter, see an example below\footnote{On the Facebook
  The Paleography Society group Lisa Howarth wrote
  (\tbsurl{www.facebook.com/groups/7687162686/permalink/10158299890607687})
  \textit{When attached to an 'h', it usually means 'er' or 'ab'
    depending on the word. It can also stand as a more general
    abbreviation in longer words [\ldots]}.}. However because the
diacritic touches the base letter, I prefer to treat them as a whole.

Essentially the same diacritic is used also with the letter \Ju{b}
which is in turn ligated with the long \textit{s}, cf. example
(63). David Baker suggest to encode it as the sequence of \Ju{ſ},
\Ju{b} and \Ju{◌̵} (\ucode{0335} \uname{COMBINING SHORT STROKE
  OVERLAY})%
\footnote{\tbsurl{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/233}},
which in the Junicode should be rendered as the ligature \Ju{ſb̵}. I
 prefer to treat the ligature as a single brevigraph.

 The figure \ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} lists two brevigraphs
 based on the letter \textit{p}, namely \Ju{ꝑ} \ucode{A751}
 \uname{LATIN LETTER P WITH STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER} and \Ju{ꝓ}
 (\ucode{A753} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER P WITH FLOURISH}). The first
 character is illutrated below in example (64), the second can be seen
 in the examples (6) and (61).

 The figure lists three brevigraphs based on the letter
 \textit{q}. The first two are well known: \Ju{ꝙ} ( \ucode{A759}
 \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH DIAGONAL STROKE}), cf. example
 (65)\footnote{The brevigraph is often used as a separate word.}, and
 \Ju{} (\mcode{E8BF} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL
   ET [MUFI 4.0]}), cf. example (66).The third one is \uname{LATIN
   SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL ET [MUFI 4.0]} with a diacritic
 mark, which can be interpreted as \Ju{◌ᷓ } \ucode {1DD3}
 \uname{COMBINING LATIN SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} mentioned
 earlier, giving the interpretation\Ju{ꝙᷓ}. Another interpretation,
 used here, is just \Ju{◌̈} (\ucode{0308} \uname{COMBINING
   DIAERESIS}). The brevigraph can be used as a separate word.

 The figure lists two brevigraphs based on the long \textit{s}. The
 first one is \Ju{} (\mcode{E8B7} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S
   WITH FLOURISH [MUFI 4.0]} seen on the example (68);
 it can also be used as a separate word(its
 interpretation were suggested on the Facebook Paleography Group by
 Gionata Brusa and Carolus Hrachowiczensis
 \footnote{\tbsurl{https://www.facebook.com/groups/7687162686/posts/10159250228377687}}). The second one, the ligature
 with the letter \textit{h} and a diacritic mark, was discussed above.

Example (69) illustrates the brevigraph \Ju{ↄ} (\ucode{2184}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED C}) and example (70) shows the
brevigraph \Ju{ꝰ} (\ucode{A770} \uname{MODIFIER LETTER US}).

The figure \ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} lists also a brevigraphs
in the form of an insular \textit{d} with a diacritical
mark\footnote{\tbsurl{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/133}}
and a \textit{v} with a diacritic mark, but they don't occur in the
text of Rubricella.

\subsection{Other characters}
\label{sec:other-characters}

Other characters listed in the figure fall into two categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item digits,
\item punctuation marks in a rather large sense.
\end{itemize}
Besides the full stop and the semicolon, we have here a hyphen, namely
\Ju{⸗} (\ucode{2E17} \uname{DOUBLE OBLIQUE HYPHEN}), an asterix (not
  present in Rubricella) and a so called
  rubric\footnote{\tbsurl{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric}} which
  can be interpreted as \Ju{⁌} (\ucode{204C} \uname{BLACK LEFTWARDS
    BULLET})\footnote{\tbsurl{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/93}}.

\section{Final remarks}
\label{sec:final-remarks}

The workflow presented here can be considered an exemplification of
the rule \textit{The best tool is the tool you know best} (author
unknown to me). It is acceptable for hobbyists, but for a serious
reasearch, subject to the principle \textit{publish or perish}, it
seems too cumbersome and time-consuming. A possible way to streamline
the workflow would be to extend \prname{djview4poliqarp} with some
appropriate import and export facilities, but it is practically
impossible because the program is orphaned.

An another extreme can be illustrated e.g. by a
complicated workflow presented in a recent paper
\cite{kordon03:_class}.

Some time ago I wrote \textit{a printed or typed text is quite
  different from any other kind of utterance, because it is in fact a
  string of characters from a finite, well defined alphabet.}
\cite[p. 143]{bc427}. As you can see I was too optimistic, the "alphabet" of
old prints is far from being well defined.  There are still some open
questions concerning the form (and the content) of the Rubricella and
Ungler's font number 1 which deserve further investigation.

Last but not least the reader should be warned that I don't know Latin
and my knowledge of paleo(typo)graphy is rather rudimentary. I tried
to cross-check the statements made in the paper, but I could miss
something. I will appreciate all comments and corrections.
