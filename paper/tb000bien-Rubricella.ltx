\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The goal of the paper is twofold.  One goal is to present a minor
  contribution to the task of describing the character inventory of a
  16th century Polish printing house; for this purpose it is necessary
  to present also some theoretical aspects of the task. Another one is
  to discuss the use of \XeLaTeX{} and other tools in the author's
  workflow.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The idea to create the inventory of characters for Polish early
printing houses dates back to 1920.
It was proposed by Ludwik
Bernacki \cite{bernacki20:_monum},\footnote{It is worth noting that
  the idea of an inventory has been proposed
  independently from time to time, e.g.\ \cite{Cassetin2003}.}
probably inspired by
Konrad Haebler's \textit{Typenrepertorium der Wiegendrucke}, which
started to appear in
1905.\footnote{\tbsurl{tw.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/}}

The 12 volumes of the series entitled \textit{Polonia Typographica
  Saeculi Sedecim} published in 1936--1981 were an attempt to implement
this concept. According to
\cite{johnson65:_polon_typog_saecul_sedec}, the layout of the tables
followed the publications of \textit{Gesellschaft für
  Typenkunde}.\footnote{\raggedright
  \tbsurl{https://worldcat.org/search?q=au=Gesellschaft\%20fu\%CC\%88r\%20Typenkunde\%20des\%20XV\%20Jahrhunderts
%  -Wiegendruckgesellschaft
%worldcat.org/identities/nc-gesellschaft fur typenkunde des xv
%jahrhunderts berlin
}}  Since volume
\acro{III}, the fonts were documented not only with text samples, but also
with tables of characters
(Fig.~\ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112}); reportedly they were
created by cutting with a razor blade the characters from
copies, probably made with the photozincography method, and pasting them
together.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    112: font number 1}
  \label{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112}
\end{figure}

With the exception of the small samples included in the publications,
the authors of the series worked
with original prints. In the meantime many of those prints have been
digitized and are available on the Internet. Hence it is possible to
compare the character sets provided in \textit{Polonia Typographica}
with the texts which are supposed to use them. The first (and for the
time being the only) such attempt, described in
\cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog}, concerned the so-called font (in
Polish paleo\-typographical terminology \textit{pismo}) number 1 of Florian
Ungler’s first printing shop (1510–1516). It revealed some surprising
discrepancies.

According to the editor of the third volume of \textit{Polonia
  Typographica} \cite{bułhak:_pierw_florian_ungler1}, the font in
question was used in only three publications,\footnote{I take this claim
  for granted, but it would be nice to verify it.} all of them digitized
  by now:
\begin{enumerate}\frenchspacing\raggedright
\item 
  \textit{Algorithmus} [\ldots] by Sacro Bosco (1511):
\cite{sacro11:_algor_ioann_de_sacro_busto},
\item \textit{Almanach ad a. 1511} by Aurifaber:
 \cite{cracoviensis11:_alman}, 
\item \textit{Rubricella
  dioecesis Cracoviensis ad a. 1511} (author unknown):
\cite{nieznany10:_rubric_cracov}. 
\end{enumerate}
We will focus here on the third item, see Fig.~\ref{fig:Rubr} (the
page format is \textit{plano} (i.e.\ un unfolded
sheet\tburlfootnote{http://ihl.enssib.fr/paper-and-watermarks-as-bibliographical-evidence/the-shape-of-paper}),
I don't know the exact size) which was used in
\cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog} in a very limited way.

 \begin{figure*}

   \includegraphics[height=.97\vsize,trim=15 15 15 15,clip]{imgR/Rubricella}
   \caption{\textit{Rubricella
  dioecesis Cracoviensis ad a.\ 1511}}
   \label{fig:Rubr}
 \end{figure*}

 The print quality is low, the font is worn out, so for many letters
 the impression of the typeface is incomplete or distorted in some
 other way. Unfortunately there is no information about the earlier
 uses of the font (Ungler came to Poland from Bavaria).

\section{Typemes}
\label{sec:typemes-1}
It is far from clear what the basic units of texts are (and how they
should be called),
especially when working with old texts.

To account for different user needs, in
\cite[p.~22]{robinson06:_guidel_trans_manus_wife_baths_prolog} four
levels of transcriptions were identified: graphic, graphetic,
graphemic and regularized. A different classification is used in
\cite[p.~4]{romein_c_annemieke_2022_7267245} which, for so-called
Ground-Truth texts, distinguishes diplomatic,\footnote{The adjective is
  derived from \textit{diplomatics}
  (\tbsurl{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatics}), not
  \textit{diplomacy}.} semi-diplomatic and hyper-diplomatic
transcriptions.  Indeed, talking about transcription levels is not
precise; there is a whole multi-dimensional space of transcriptions
differing in independent aspects of editing (e.g.\ are ligatures
preserved? Are abbreviation marks resolved? Are misprints corrected?).

Our primary goal is the ``typemic'' transcription, representing a text
as a sequence of typemes in the sense of Jacques André.  He introduced
the notion of typeme (in French, \textit{typème}) in
\cite{typemes2022}, and elaborated on it in
\cite{andre:halshs-00983575}, where the notion of typemic transcription
was introduced. Specific typemes are listed in several
draft technical notes by André, available at
\tbsurl{jacques-andre.fr/PICA/}. The most recent
\cite{andré22:_inven_unicod_mufi} lists 1172 typemes. The typeme is
described as the ``cast character'', considered regardless of the design
and size, in other words the typemes are the glyphs of characters
present in the [metal]
typefaces.\footnote{From \cite[p.~4]{andré22:_inven_unicod_mufi}:
  \textit{«caractère fondu» mais sans tenir compte ni du dessin, ni de
    la taille des caractères. On peut dire que ce sont les glyphes des
    caractères présents dans les polices de caractères au sens
    original d’inventaire (décompte des sortes)}.
    Incidentally, the notion of
  typeme in other meaning has been used by a Swedish linguist Göran
  Hammarström, but this is not relevant to our purposes.}

In other words, we want to represent precisely the print types/sorts
of the text transcribed.

The typemes are
assigned the code points of the Unicode characters if appropriate ones
exist, sometimes in the case of polysemic glyphs
(\cite[p.~129]{andre:halshs-00983575}) in an arbitrary way.

Usually it is not sufficient to provide users with only one type of
transcription. If the document is available on a server, then usually the
server software allows switching between various transcriptions. It is
desirable to have a similar option for documents downloaded
on a local computer. Theoretically \PDF\ can be used for this, as
multiple layers of text are allowed, e.g.\ for engineering and other
applications. An example of a different idea for presenting multiple
aspects of old texts in a single \PDF\ document is discussed in
\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-91669-5_5}.   In DjVu
documents, it might be useful to use the hidden text layer for the
typemic transcription and the
annotations to provide another version of the transcription, but this
is outside the scope of this paper.

\section{Workflow}
\label{sec:workflow}


\subsection{The sources}
\label{sec:sources}

Latin \textit{rubricella} (in Polish
\textit{rubrycela}\footnote{\tbsurl{pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubrycela}})
is another name of the \textit{Directorium Divini
  Officii}\footnote{\tbsurl{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorium}}
or \textit{Ordo Divini Officii}; the rubricellae discussed here have a
very simple form.

In the digital library, the rubricella we're concerned with is
accompanied by three pages of a
typewritten text reconstructing the fragments missing (the page has
been trimmed) or damaged; the reconstruction was based on another
rubricella for this year printed by another printer, namely Jan
(Johann) Haller, and preserved in the Jagiellonian Library as
\textit{Cim.\ vol.~4}.  It is not digitized, but Jacek Patryka, the
head of Old Prints Section, kindly provided me with a high quality
photo.

The reconstruction was not based directly on Haller's rubricella, but
on ``Sawicki's copy''. At first this remark was unclear to me, but
later Mark Thakkar on the Facebook group of \textit{The Paleography
  Society} pointed Sawicki's book out to me
\cite{sawicki45:_statut_jana_konar}, which contains the full text of
Haller's rubricella (following common editorial practice, almost
all abbreviations have been resolved and expanded).

Although the content of the rubricella is in principle not relevant to
the character inventory, I compared the sources, creating a
parallel text, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:RubrParallel}: Haller's
% essential correction!
rubricella in Sawicki's transcription,
reconstructed Ungler's rubricella transcription, original Ungler
rubricella typemic transcription.  In particular, this
allowed for resolving some non-obvious abbreviations. On the
other hand the parallel text revealed some strange discrepancies, but
this is outside the scope of this paper.

 \begin{figure*}

   \caption{The parallel text of the rubricella versions}
% /home/jsbien/git/repertuarXVI/Rubricella/Rubricella_parallel.pdf
   \label{fig:RubrParallel}
 \end{figure*}

 The parallel text was typeset using
 \texttt{expex}\footnote{\tbsurl{ctan.org/pkg/expex}} by John
 Frampton; according to its author's description \textit{The package
   provides macros for typesetting linguistic examples and glosses,
   with a refined mechanism for referencing examples and parts of
   examples}. The name is derived from the names of the two basic
 commands, \verb+\ex+ and \verb+\pex+, which in turn are abbreviations of
 \textit{example} and \textit{parts example}.

\subsection{Image preprocessing}
\label{sec:image-preprocessing}

% Eliminating controversial "plano"
Working with a very large page would be cumbersome even on a large
display, so I decided to split the page into five parts, in reading
order: the initial single column text, the left narrow column, the
left half-page column, the right narrow column, the right half-page
column. The digital library provides the document in the DjVu format
(once very popular\footnote{To make a long story short, the original
  reasons for creating it are no longer valid, but it is still the
  best format for some purposes; see, e.g.\ \cite{bc71}.})  but there
are no tools for such editing in this format.  Hence the document was
exported as a graphic file with
\textsf{djview}\footnote{\tbsurl{djvu.sourceforge.net/djview4.html}}
and split into \PNG\ files with Gimp.\footnote{\tbsurl{gimp.org/}}

The transcription process described below for unknown reason degrades
the scan quality. Therefore they were also converted to a DjVu
document with the \textsf{didjvu} program. The program was
written by Jakub Wilk, who no longer maintains it, in Python~2. I am
using now Friedric Foebel's Python~3
fork.\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/FriedrichFroebel/didjvu}}


\subsection{The transcription}
\label{sec:transcription}

For transcription the so-called Expert Client to the Transkribus
system\footnote{\tbsurl{readcoop.eu/transkribus/}. The Expert
  Client is no longer supported as it has been phased out by a Web
  interface. The formal status of the system is complicated. Some
  tools are open source and free (\tbsurl{github.com/Transkribus/}),
  while the use of other
  tools is charged per page.} was used;
see Fig.~\ref{fig:Trans}.

It is worth mentioning that the Optical Character Recognition feature,
understood literally, is no longer in use. It was replaced by neural
network tools, usually named Handwritten Text Recognition (\acro{HTR}), which
operate on the whole lines of texts. Although the results of \acro{HTR} are
often quite impressive, the segmentation into characters and even
words is not needed for these algorithms. The tools for such
detailed segmentations are not available easily, at least I did not
find any such tool appropriate for my goals.\footnote{%
  In particular, the Glyph Miner software package
  (\tbsurl{https://github.com/benedikt-budig/glyph-miner/}) looked
  quite promising, but its use appeared prohibitively difficult,
  primarily because of the lack of sufficient documentation
  (\tbsurl{https://github.com/benedikt-budig/glyph-miner/discussions/14}).}

The images created with Gimp and uploaded to Transkribus are
segmented into text lines automatically, but the low quality of the
print confused the algorithm quite often, so extensive manual
corrections were needed.\footnote{For the reasons mentioned,
  Transkribus does not provide a tool for an automatic word
  segmentation. It is possible to do it by hand, but it is rather
  cumbersome, so I preferred to defer this operation to a later stage
  of the workflow.}


 \begin{figure*}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{imgR/Transkribus}
   \caption{The transcription window of Transkribus Expert Client}
   \label{fig:Trans}
 \end{figure*}


 In the transcription I use \Ssgl{⧺} (\ucode{29FA} \uname{DOUBLE
   PLUS}) to mark a missing beginning or ending of a word, and
 \Ssgl{⋯} (\ucode{22EF} \uname{MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS}) to mark a
 whole missing word. Moreover I use \Ssgl{⚠} (\ucode{26A0}
 \uname{WARNING SIGN}) to mark fragments which require special
 attention, and I use \Ssgl{�} \ucode{FFFD} \uname{REPLACEMENT
   CHARACTER} for illegible characters.

I didn't aim at a perfect transcription; it is good to
 delay some decisions to a later stage.

 Transkribus supports exporting the transcription in several formats.
 The ultimate format for me is the DjVu format mentioned earlier.
 I quite often exported a \PDF\ file, with the \textit{images plus text
   layer} option selected, until I encountered a problem with the (no
 longer maintained) \textsf{pdf2djvu}
 program by Jakub Wilk.\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/pdf2djvu/issues/1}}

 So, this time I decided to export the transcription in the \acro{ALTO} format
 (\textit{Analyzed Layout and Text
   Object})\footnote{\tbsurl{loc.gov/standards/alto/}}
with the option \textit{Split Lines Into Words}.

It should be noted that recognizing words in old prints without
understanding the text or using a dictionary is close to impossible,
because of inconsistent use of the horizontal
(interword\slash interletter) spaces. I don't know what algorithm is used by
the \acro{ALTO} export but the results, at least for \textit{Rubricella},
were unfortunately not satisfactory and required manual adjustment,
which was done during the indexing phase.


 The \acro{ALTO} files (one file for each page) were converted first to
 \textit{h\acro{OCR}} (\cite{BREU2007}) with the \textsf{ocr-transform}
 tool.\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/UB-Mannheim/ocr-fileformat}}

 The next step was using the \textsf{html2djvused} program. Originally
 written by Jakub Wilk in Python~2 and distributed with
 \textsf{ocrodjvu},\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/jwilk-archive/ocrodjvu}}
 it is no longer maintained by him.  Several forks exist with more or
 less complete conversion to Python~3, and I used one of
 these.\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/rockclimb/hocr2djvused}}  As the
 name suggests, the output of \textsf{html2djvused} was used by
 \textsf{djvused}, one of the tools of the DjVuLibre
 library,\footnote{\tbsurl{djvu.sourceforge.net/}} to import the
 transcription as the hidden text layer into the DjVu document
 mentioned earlier in section \ref{sec:image-preprocessing}.

 Last but not least, the basic metadata has been inserted into the
 document, providing in particular the link to the digital library
 containing the original version.  This is the document which is
 used in the later stages of the workflow. 

 
 \subsection{Indexing and annotating}
\label{sec:indexing-annotating}

The next step in the workflow intensively used the
\textsf{djview4poliqarp}
program\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/djview-poliqarp_fork}}
(designed by myself and programmed by Michał Rudolf).  At first it was
just a fork of \textsf{djview} intended to facilitate the use of DjVu
corpora; %\cite{bc177},
see, e.g.\ \cite{bc381}.
Later, the program was extended to create and browse simple
indexes to DjVu
documents.\footnote{E.g.\ \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/iLindeCSV},\newline
  \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/Zaborowski-index4djview}}

From the technical point of view the indexes are just simple \CSV\
files (using semicolon as the separator). 
  Every line of an index file consists of three or four fields:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The text used for sorting and incremental search.
\item The reference to the relevant image fragment in the form used by the
  \textsf{djview4} viewer mentioned earlier, namely a Universal
  Resource Locator. Some fully-fledged examples can be found in
  the indexes to Linde's dictionary, in particular in the tiny index
  of the planet
  symbols.\footnote{\raggedright
    \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/iLindeCSV/blob/master/Linde-znaki/planety.csv}}

  In the indexes discussed here the scheme and authority parts are
  absent, and the path is limited to the file names; this means in
  practice that \prname{djview4poliqarp} has to be called with the
  index directory as the default one. The fragment part is also
  missing, and the query part contains the dimensions and the
  coordinates of the image fragment in the \textsf{djview4} specific
  form;
  it can also contain the specification of a
  color used for highlighting. The referenced image fragment has to be
  rectangular, but a single url can reference several such fragments.
\item A description: text displayed for the current entry in a small
  window under the index.
\item An optional comment displayed after the entry; we precede it by
  ※ (\ucode{203B} \uname{REFERENCE MARK}) for a more distinctive
  display. It was absent in the first versions of the program and was
  added later, primarily to distinguish homographs.
\end{enumerate}

% private repo, so omit ... \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/djvused4indexes} 
The initial index is created by a quick-and-dirty modification of the
above-mentioned \prname{djvused} program.\footnote{At present, I keep it in a
  private repository as I
  hope to replace it by something more elegant which I will make
  public. Help here would be greatly appreciated.} Here is an example
of a line created by the program for \textit{Rubricella}; it is composed from
the following fields (below split into several lines for editorial
reasons):
\begin{enumerate}
\item \sgl{ↄꝺuctus} (the entry),
\item \verb|file:Rubricela_1511_Unglera.djvu?|\\
  \verb|djvuopts=&page=0003|\\
  \verb|&highlight=0237,2075,0117,0019| (the url,\\ with no color
  specification; as we use a rudimentary form of the path, the file
  has to be present in the current directory),
\item \verb|Rubricela_1511_Unglera.djvu p=3 l=19|\\ \verb|tl=258 w=39 tw=530|
  (the description: the file name, the page number, the line number on
  the page, the line number in the document, the word
  number on the page, the word number in the document; especially
  useful when several indexes are merged),
\item ※ \sgl{ↄꝺuctus} (the comment, initially equal to the entry but
  prefixed by ※ for the reason mentioned earlier, usually somehow
  edited later to contain the transcription, in this case,
  \textit{conductus}).
\end{enumerate}

 \begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{imgR/Rubricella1}
   \caption{The incorrect bounding box of an original index entry}
   \label{fig:Trans2}
 \end{figure}

  \begin{figure}
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{imgR/Rubricella2}
   \caption{The manually corrected bounding box of the entry}
   \label{fig:Trans3}
 \end{figure}
 
 The index, in addition to being browsed with the \prname{djview4poliqarp}
 program, also has other applications, e.g.\ a simple \prname{sed}
 script
 creates a secondary index where the comments are entries and
 \textit{vice versa}.\footnote{See the \prname{sed} directory at
   \tbsurl{github.com/jsbien/Zaborowski-index4djview}.\raggedright}

 Using \prname{djview4poliqarp}, I corrected by hand the borders of
 practically all 1638 words of \textit{Rubricella};
 see Figs.~\ref{fig:Trans2} and~\ref{fig:Trans3}. It would be nice to
 incorporate the changes into the hidden text layer. It can be done
 with a very simple program which is, however, yet to be written.
 
 To double-check the index it is good to make a histogram of all the
 characters occurring in the text. For this, I have usually used
 \prname{unihistext},\footnote{\tbsurl{https://github.com/jsbien/unihistext}}
 a fork of Bill Poser's \prname{unihist}, implemented some time ago by
 a student of mine following my suggestions. It provided the names for
 the Unicode and some private use characters and their combining
 sequences. Unfortunately, it was written in Python 2 and its
 adaptation to Python 3 does not seem trivial. Hence now I have to use
 the original \prname{unihist}.


 It should be noted that it is very easy to create various specialised
 subindexes by extracting the relevant lines of the \CSV\ file with,
 e.g.\ \prname{grep}. For this purpose some special tags can be added
 to selected fields (with \prname{djview4poliqarp} or a favourite text
 or spreadsheet editor). Such subindexes can be used in particular for
 snippet extraction described below.

\subsection{Snippets extraction}
\label{sec:snippets-extraction}
The main tool for snippet extraction is \prname{ddjvu}, and calls to
\prname{ddjvu} are generated by a \prname{sed} script;
see Figs.~\ref{sed1} and~\ref{sed1example}.  You might notice that the
graphic snippet file name incorporates the information about its
origin. I consider this very useful, but unfortunately due to a
not-yet-fixed bug it is not always reliable.

To allow for including the snippets in a \LaTeX{} document we convert
them to \PNG\ format; see Fig.~\ref{convert}.

Finally, another \prname{sed} script (Fig.~\ref{sed2}), creates
appropriate \LaTeX{} code snippets to facilitate creating figures; here,
please note
that the entry field is preserved as the comment (Fig.~\ref{sed2example}).

\section{The inventory}
\label{sec:inventory}

The inventory is presented using the \prname{expex} package mentioned
earlier. The first line contains the graphic snippets, and the second
the subsequent numbers for reference purposes. The third line contains
the typemic transcription typeset with the Junicode Two font, and the last
one contains a kind of high-level transcription for clarity, for which I
don't have
a name yet. I apply the following rules, roughly in the order listed.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ligatures are split into the component letters, e.g. \Ju{}
  becomes \Ju{ſ\/i} and \Ju{ĳ} becomes
% unable to disable this ligature!!!:
  `{\cJ{{i}}\null\cJ{{j}}}'. The letters may be
  subject to further processing, e.g.\ \Ju{ſ\/i} becomes \Ju{si} and
  \Ju{i\/j} becomes \Ju{ii} (there was\slash is no letter \Ju{j} in
  Latin;\footnote{\raggedright \tbsurl{medium.com/in-medias-res/theres-no-j-in-latin-your-holiness-5a331c3f7a06}}
  nevertheless \Ju{j} was\slash is used in the so-called Ramist
  forms\footnote{The name comes from Pierre de la Ramée (Petrus
    Ramus); see
%% [cert problems with https]
%%    \tbsurl{www.stmarys-parish.org/Latin/LatinSpelling.htm}.}).
      \tbsurl{http://stmarys-parish.org/Latin/LatinSpelling.htm}.}).
\item Obsolete letters (or rather obsolete letter shapes) are replaced
  by their modern equivalents, e.g.\ \Ju{ſ} becomes \Ju{s} and \Ju{ꝺ}
  becomes \Ju{d}.
\item Ambiguities of \Ju{u} and \Ju{i} are resolved and replaced by
  the Ramist forms, i.e.\ when appropriate \Ju{u} is replaced by \Ju{v}
  and \Ju{i} by \Ju{j},\footnote{Reportedly
    \tbsurl{alatius.com/macronizer/} should be able to do this
    automatically.} e.g.\ \Ju{Aue} becomes \Ju{Ave}.
\item Brevigraphs\footnote{This term is used by me in a narrow sense to
    refer to a scribal abbreviation in the form of a single
    character.} are resolved; in most cases their meaning is
  obvious, but sometimes understanding the context is needed, e.g.\
  isolated \Ju{ꝑ} becomes \Ju{per} and \Ju{ꝑmanente} becomes
  \Ju{permanente} but \Ju{coꝛꝑe} becomes \Ju{corpore}.
\item Other abbreviations are resolved, which sometimes may require good
  understanding of the context, e.g.\ \Ju{an̄e} means here \Ju{antiphonae}
  but this is far from obvious; moreover there are special rules for
  \textit{nomina sacra}, see below.
\item Letter case is adjusted to be compatible with modern spelling.
\item Obvious mistakes are noted and corrected.
\end{enumerate}
These rules describe the transcription of single words. For multiword
texts, additional rules are needed for marking the proper segmentation,
but we won't use them here.
This ``transcription for clarity'' is provided only when it differs from
the typemic transcription.

The typemic transcription uses the default character glyphs, which can
be sometimes quite different from the original. In some fonts a better
approximation of the shape can be achieved using OpenType features,
e.g.\ in Junicode \Ju{ꝉ} can be rendered as \Ju{󰀏} using
\verb|cv17| (\verb|cv| stands for character variant). 


\subsection{Some problems of typemic transcription}
\label{sec:some-probl-typem}


Peter Robinson,\footnote{\tbsurl{artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/PRobinson}}
the editor of the manuscripts of Geoffrey Chaucer, wrote
\cite[pp.~186--187]{robinson16:_digit_revol_schol_editin}:
\begin{quotation}
\textrm{scribes, over and over, don’t seem to care whether the two
  minims\footnote{\raggedright Wikipedia
    (\tbsurl{en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minim_(palaeography)})
    states: \textit{A minim is the basic stroke for the letters i, m,
      n, and u in uncial script and later scripts deriving from it};
    the limitation to specific scripts does not seem necessary.} are
  joined at the top (as in a modern printed n; [\ldots]%
) or joined at the bottom (as in a
modern printed u; [\ldots]%
), or not joined at all.
And then, what we call a macron takes
a bewildering variety of forms. Sometimes it is indeed a single straight
stroke over the letter. Sometimes it extends over several letters. Often
it is curved. And very often it appears as a loop, beginning at the base
of the last minim and arching back over the two minims of the u/n
character and preceding letters. Attempting to devise transcription
protocols in these circumstances is a complex dance with a collection
of hydra. The intentions of the scribes appear increasingly opaque and
distant, and we are left searching our own intentions. Exactly what
are we trying to record; for who; and why?}
\end{quotation}

To my surprise the problem with minims occurs in
\textit{Rubricella}, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:minim}.

\end{figure}
%
Sometimes \Ju{n} is used instead of \Ju{u}, cf.\ example (8) and
\textit{vice versa}, cf.\ examples (2) and (7). Sometimes \Ju{m} is
used in place of \Ju{in} or \Ju{ni}, cf.\ examples (1) and (3), and
sometimes \Ju{un} is used as \Ju{im}, cf.\ example (6).

However, the
most intriguing are the fragments where \Ju{m}, \Ju{n} and \Ju{u} look
just like a sequence of dotless \textit{{i}}, cf.\ examples (4) and
(9). I have no idea whether this is an effect of the type being worn
down, or whether it is an intentional use of the dotless \textit{i}. In
consequence it is not clear what the typemic representation
of such fragments should be. For the time being I have no answer to this
question. I also don't know whether this phenomenon occurs also in
other prints of that time.

On the other hand the various shapes of the overline abbreviation mark
definitely appear also in this and other publications (see some
examples below). All of them are encoded, at least at present,
just as a macron (in Unicode \Ju{◌̄} \ucode{25CC} \uname{COMBINING
  MACRON}).
% , cf. e.g. \cite{bień21:_trakt_stanis_zabor}.

Another problem worth mentioning concerns the variants of letter
\textit{i}. There is no doubt that \Ju{ī} (in Unicode \ucode{012B}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH MACRON}) is an abbreviation, but the
dotless \textit{\i},\footnote{By the way, this is the primary form of
  the letter; the dot, called technically a tittle, appeared in the
  Middle Ages; see, e.g.\
  \tbsurl{quora.com/Why-do-“i”-and-“j”-posses-a-dot}.}
the standard \textit{i} with dot and \textit{\'\i} with acute seem to be
used with the same function, When there is no doubt about the shape,
they are encoded respectively as \Ju{ı} \ucode{0131} \uname{LATIN
  SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I}, \Ju{i} \ucode{0069} \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LETTER I} and \Ju{í} \ucode{00ED} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH
  ACUTE}.

In some cases \Ju{c} is used instead of \Ju{e}; some examples:

{\Junicode
\exdisplay
\bg
\gla    
\includegraphics[height=3ex]{snippets/snippet_RubricellaUnglerTrJSB_page5x831y1220} % diei

It is not clear whether they are just mistakes or intentional
replacements due to technical limitations.

\caption{More miniscule examples}
\label{fig:more-miniscule}
\end{figure}

Some minuscules are supplemented by an abbreviation mark, usually a more
or less horizontal line over the letter, conventionally encoded as a
macron. Sometimes the mark resembles a tilde (example (57)), % ꝺn̈ıcā
or a
flattened circumflex (example (50)). % ⁊c̄
Sometimes the abbreviation is
marked by a diaeresis (example (46)). % 
Sometimes the bar is so short that it looks like a dot (example
(58)). %
The most intriguing is the abbreviation mark in example (60). Is this
just a diaeresis? Or a little known character \uname{COMBINING LATIN
  SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} proposed by the Medieval Unicode
Font
Initiative?\footnote{\tbsurl{mufi.info/q.php?p=mufi/chars/unichar/7635}}
Or something else?  I don't know the definite answer, though Susana
Tavares Pedro supported my hypothesis in the Facebook Paleography
Society
group.\footnote{\raggedright \tbsurl{facebook.com/groups/7687162686/permalink/10159164467367687}}
On the other hand, in Fig.~\ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} the
diacritical mark over \textit{s} looks rather like a macron.

It is interesting to compare the letter \textit{l} in examples (4)
and e.g.\ (15). Is this the same type/sort from the same font? I'm not
sure.

A reader may be curious what the letter \Ju{Ʒ}, usually just
the equivalent of \Ju{z}, is doing in the abbreviation of
\Ju{capitulum} (example (54)). This is an example of a homographic
character; it
should be interpreted, at some level of transcription, as Unicode
\ucode{A76B} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER ET} (in Junicode: \Ju{ꝫ}).  The
scribes used to write \Ju{m} vertically to save the space, the letter
written this way looked as \Ju{ꝫ}, so one of its meanings is just
\Ju{m}.

A reader may be also curious what \Ju{x} and \Ju{p} are doing in an
abbreviation of \Ju{Christi} (example (58)). The answer is that \Ju{x}
stands for the
Greek \textit{chi}, and \Ju{p} for the Greek \textit{rho}.  This is just
an example of the special abbreviation rules for \textit{nomina
  sancta}.

\subsection{Ligatures}
\label{sec:ligatures}

Besides the ligatures classified here as brevigraphs and discussed
below, Fig.~\ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} lists only \Ju{ﬀ}
(\ucode{FB00} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FF}). However, in the text
we can see also \Ju{ﬅ} (\ucode{FB05} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE LONG
  S T}, example (5)), \Ju{} (\mcode{EBA3}\footnote{Using the \acro{M}
  prefix for the characters from the recommendation of Medieval
  Unicode Font Initiative was proposed by me in \cite{bc480}; I've
  spotted this convention used independently elsewhere, unfortunately
  I don't remember where.} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE LONG S L [MUFI
  4.0]}, example (29)), and \Ju{} (\mcode{EBA2} \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LIGATURE LONG S I [MUFI 4.0]}, example (39)).

The ligature \Ju{ĳ} (\ucode{0133} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE IJ},
example (10)), is just a variant of \Ju{ii}, as already
mentioned.

\subsection{Brevigraphs}
\label{sec:brevigraphs}



Some popular brevigraphs have already occurred in the examples above, namely
\Ju{⁊} (\ucode{204A} \uname{TIRONIAN SIGN ET}, in
the Junicode
font also \Ju{󰀝}; see example (50)), \Ju{ꝉ} (\ucode{A749}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH HIGH STROKE}, in Junicode also
\Ju{󰀏}), which occurs with different meanings in examples (52),
(53) and (54), and \Ju{ꝝ} (\ucode{A75D} \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LETTER RUM ROTUNDA}) (example (53)).


I prefer to classify the character encoded here as \Ju{h̵}\footnote{Its
  shape can be also approximated by \Ju{} (\mcode{E8A3} \uname{LATIN ABBREVIATION SIGN AUTEM [MUFI 4.0]}).}
(\ucode{0068} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER H} followed by \ucode{0335}
\uname{COMBINING SHORT STROKE OVERLAY}), in Junicode also
\Ju{\addfontfeatures{CharacterVariant=16:0}h̵}\footnote{\tbsurl{github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/134}},
see also example (51), as a brevigraph, but the diacritic can be used also
with other letters; see an example below.\footnote{In the Facebook
  Paleography Society group, Lisa Howarth wrote
  (\tbsurl{facebook.com/groups/7687162686/permalink/10158299890607687})
  \textit{When attached to an `h', it usually means `er' or `ab'
    depending on the word. It can also stand as a more general
    abbreviation in longer words [\ldots]}.\raggedright} However, because the
diacritic touches the base letter, I prefer to treat them as a whole.

Essentially the same diacritic is used also with the letter \Ju{b}
which is in turn ligated with the long \textit{s}; see example
(63). David Baker suggested encoding it as the sequence of \Ju{ſ},
\Ju{b} and \Ju{◌̵} (\ucode{0335} \uname{COMBINING SHORT STROKE
  OVERLAY}),\footnote{\tbsurl{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/233}}
which in the Junicode font is rendered as the ligature \Ju{ſb̵}. I
 prefer to treat the ligature as a single brevigraph.

 Fig.~\ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} lists two brevigraphs
 based on the letter \textit{p}, namely \Ju{ꝑ} (\ucode{A751}
 \uname{LATIN LETTER P WITH STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER}) and \Ju{ꝓ}
 (\ucode{A753} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER P WITH FLOURISH}). The first
 character is illustrated below in example (64), the second can be seen
 in examples (6) and (61).

 The figure lists three brevigraphs based on the letter
 \textit{q}. The first two are well known: \Ju{ꝙ} (\ucode{A759}
 \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH DIAGONAL STROKE}), see example
 (65),\footnote{The brevigraph is often used as a separate word.} and
 \Ju{} (\mcode{E8BF} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL
   ET [MUFI 4.0]}), see example (66). The third is \uname{LATIN
   SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL ET [MUFI 4.0]} with a diacritic
 mark, which can be interpreted as the \Ju{◌ᷓ } \ucode {1DD3}
 \uname{COMBINING LATIN SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} mentioned
 earlier, giving the interpretation \Ju{ꝙᷓ}. Another interpretation,
 used here, is just \Ju{◌̈} (\ucode{0308} \uname{COMBINING
   DIAERESIS}). The brevigraph can be used as a separate word.

 The figure lists two brevigraphs based on the long \textit{s}. The
 first one is \Ju{} (\mcode{E8B7} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S
   WITH FLOURISH [MUFI 4.0]}, seen in example (68)); it can also be
 used as a separate word (its interpretations were suggested in the
 Facebook Paleography Society group by Gionata Brusa and Carolus
 Hrachowiczensis\footnote{\raggedright
 \tbsurl{https://facebook.com/groups/7687162686/posts/10159250228377687}}). The
 second one, the ligature with the letter \textit{h} and a diacritic
 mark, was discussed above.

Further, example (69) illustrates the brevigraph \Ju{ↄ} (\ucode{2184}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED C}) and example (70) shows the
brevigraph \Ju{ꝰ} (\ucode{A770} \uname{MODIFIER LETTER US}).

Fig.~\ref{fig:Ungler1_pismo01_tab112} also lists brevigraphs
in the form of an insular \textit{d} with a diacritical
mark\footnote{\tbsurl{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/133}}
and a \textit{v} with a diacritical mark, but they don't occur in the
text of \textit{Rubricella}.

\subsection{Other characters}
\label{sec:other-characters}

Other characters listed in the figure fall into two categories:
digits, and (in a rather large sense) punctuation marks.
Besides the full stop and the semicolon, we have here a hyphen, namely
\Ju{⸗} (\ucode{2E17} \uname{DOUBLE OBLIQUE HYPHEN}), an asterisk (not
  present in \textit{Rubricella}) and a so-called
  rubric\footnote{\tbsurl{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric}} which
  can be interpreted as \Ju{⁌} (\ucode{204C} \uname{BLACK LEFTWARDS
    BULLET}).\footnote{\tbsurl{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/93}}

\section{Final remarks}
\label{sec:final-remarks}

The workflow presented here can be considered an exemplification of
the rule \textit{The best tool is the tool you know best} (author
unknown to me). It is acceptable for hobbyists, but for serious
research, subject to the principle \textit{publish or perish}, it
seems too cumbersome and time-consuming. A possible way to streamline
the workflow would be to extend \prname{djview4poliqarp} with some
appropriate import and export facilities, but it is practically
impossible because the program is orphaned.

Another extreme is illustrated by, for example, a
complicated workflow presented in a recent paper
\cite{kordon03:_class}.

Some time ago, I wrote \textit{a printed or typed text is quite
  different from any other kind of utterance, because it is in fact a
  string of characters from a finite, well defined alphabet.}
\cite[p.~143]{bc427}. As you can see, I was too optimistic, the ``alphabet'' of
old prints is far from being well defined.  There are still some open
questions concerning the form (and the content) of Ungler's
\textit{Rubricella} and
Ungler's font number 1 which deserve further investigation.

Last but not least the reader should be warned that I don't know Latin
and my knowledge of paleo(typo)graphy is rather rudimentary. I tried
to cross-check the statements made in the paper, but I could certainly
have made errors. I will appreciate all comments and corrections.

additional verification, in a public repository at
