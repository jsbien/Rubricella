\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% The paper is a follow up of my earlier papers, namely
% \cite{bień21:_trakt_stanis_zabor},
% \cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog} and \cite{Rubricella2023}, but
% it uses a different approach. 

The fonts of several 16th century printers active in Poland,
namely Aleksander Augezdecki, Jan Haller, Kasper Hochfeder, Florian
Ungler (the first and second printing house) and Maciej Wirzbięta, have
been described in the series of 12 fascicules entitled \textit{Polonia
  {Typographica} {Saeculi} {Sedecimi}} published in years
1959--1981.\footnote{The first two fascicules were published in 1936
  and 1937, but we are interested in their second revised editions
  because these were supplemented by the character set tables.} Almost
all of them are digitized but
  % , to
  % avoid the risk of infringing the copyright which for this
  % publication is rather unclear,
available only for ``digital lending'' in
\acro{ACADEMICA}\footnote{\raggedright \textit{Interlibrary loan system of books and
    scientific publications}: \url{https://academica.edu.pl/}}
because, I surmise, it's not clear who owns the copyright as this was a
collaborative effort of several persons (only one contributor is still
alive) and institutions.
% To save the
% space I don't give the bibliographic details here.

In the fascicules every font is illustrated by an excerpt of a text
and sometimes
% .  %The fonts discussed in
% \cite{bułhak:_pierw_florian_ungler1} and %
% \cite{bułhak:_drug_florian_ungler2}.  are
additionally by a table of the character set; an example of such a table
is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:table16}.  Most of the tables have been
prepared by Maria Błońska with some help from Anna Wolińska and Henryk
Bułhak (the editor of several fascicules); some tables were prepared
by Anna Śliwa, Alodia Kawecka Gryczowa (also the editor of several
fascicules) and Paulina Buchwald-Pelcowa (the editor of the whole
series).  The number of font tables is over seventy and the total number of
glyphs in the tables is over six thousand.

Unfortunately I missed the
opportunity to get first-hand information on how the tables were
prepared when talking by phone with Paulina Buchwald-Pelcowa in 2022
(she died two years later). I got some rudimentary information from
Henryk Bułhak, also in phone calls, but he was able to provide me only
with rather general information: the glyphs were cut out with a
razor blade from photocopies and pasted together. This information
seems relevant because it shows what kind of mistakes can be expected
in the tables: if a character occurs in a table then it can be
displaced or misassigned (see sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-g}), but
definitely exists in a text; on the other hand, some omissions are
possible. For example, the glyph in Fig.~\ref{fig:cis} is not listed
in the table in Fig.~\ref{fig:table16}, but can be found in the texts
printed reportedly with this font; according to Peter Baker, the
meaning is
\textit{cis}.\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/255}}

\end{figure}



No comments to the tables are provided, but the order of glyphs is
sometimes relevant for their interpretation (see Figures~\ref{fig:ghi},
\ref{fig:cec}, \ref{fig:ghhi}).

  \caption{A fragment of Plate 411. The third glyph is interpreted as
    \textit{h} because of its position in the font
    table.}
  \label{fig:ghhi}
\end{figure}

The quality of the glyph images is sometimes
quite low; I understand no better samples were available.

Early prints used many abbreviations which were the descendants
of the abbreviations used in manuscripts; we discuss here a subset of
them, called brevigraphs. Quite often they consisted of a regular
non-modified letter supplemented by a diacritical mark, usually a
macron or a similar glyph, placed above. It is natural to call them
composed brevigraphs. On the other hand there are abbreviations in a
shape of a modified letter or a letter-like symbol; we call them basic
brevigraphs even if they are accompanied by a diacritical mark.

The work described here consisted primarily of creating computer
indexes to allow comparison of similar characters from the same or
different fonts (Fig.~\ref{fig:index1}). The indexes and other
resources are available in a public
repository;\tburlfootnote{https://github.com/jsbien/early_fonts_inventory}
the repository site provides \textit{Issues} and \textit{Discussions}
tabs for reporting mistakes and giving comments.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{img/compare}
  \caption{Comparing characters with \textsf{djview4poliqarp}}
  \label{fig:index1}
\end{figure}


The paper is considered a progress report for two reasons. First, the
character indexes should be supplemented by indexes showing their
meaning and their use in texts, in a similar way as described in
\cite{jsb23}.  Secondly, I omitted some interesting glyphs because I
was not sure how to interpret them. An example is presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:hhh}: is the last but one glyph a modification of the
letter \textit{h}, or is this just the letter \textit{h} with a
diacritic mark which happens to touch the letter?


\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
  \includegraphics[height=5ex]{img/h_Hochfeder-03}
  \caption{A fragment of Plate 21.  Is the last but one glyph a basic
    brevigraph?}
  \label{fig:hhh}
\end{figure}


% One initial question for every basic brevigraph is whether it has been
An important question for every basic brevigraph is whether it has been
assigned a codepoint in the Unicode
standard.\tburlfootnote{https://home.unicode.org/}  Checking the
character charts is unfortunately not sufficient for two
reasons. First, the character name is not intended to provide the full
information about the character, it should be treated as a more or
less arbitrary label. Secondly, in principle (the practise is
sometimes questionable) the standard defines characters, not glyphs,
and the glyph in a chart is only one of the possible representations
of the character (an example is given in
sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-l}). In consequence it is useful to also look
up the character proposals and related documents in the Unicode
Technical Committee Document Registry\tburlfootnote{https://unicode.org/L2/} (a similar resource is the
\acro{ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2}
register\tbsurlfootnote{https://unicode.org/wg2/}). It is also
useful to look for alternative glyphs in specialized fonts
(see sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-r}).

Another interesting question is whether the brevigraph has been
assigned a codepoint in the Unicode Private Use Area by the Medieval
Unicode Font Initiative.\tburlfootnote{https://mufi.info/} The \MUFI\
assignments at first, up to version 4.0, were published as
recommendations in the form of \PDF\ documents
\cite{haugen15:_mufi1}. They list over 1500 pure Unicode and Private
Use Area characters in the Latin alphabet of potential use for the
encoding old text sources.
%  \tburlfootnote{https://www.menota.org/HB2_A_characters.xml}.

  Nowadays, the recommendations have the form of a database which can be
  browsed online (Fig.~\ref{fig:MUFI}). For some time a subset of
  the data content is also available for download, under the Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license, in the form of a \CSV\ or \acro{JSON}
  file.

\end{figure}

Last but not least, it is important whether a brevigraph can be
rendered adequately by a font.  Our primary focus is on Peter Baker's
Junicode Two font, as it is available under a free
license\tbsurlfootnote{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font} and
contains some characters not available elsewhere
\cite{bien_representing_2022}. We also use George Douros'
Symbola font\tburlfootnote{https://dn-works.com/ufas/} for some characters
not available in Junicode.

It is worth mentioning that some of the brevigraphs discussed
here were used in Gutenberg's bibles. The character set of
these books has been the subject of several publications; they are
referenced in \cite{andre15:B42} and
\cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog}.  I also found very useful the
unpublished text \cite{Bettridge} kindly provided to me by the author.
(It is attached by the Printing Museum in Lyon to digital copies of a
folio of the Gutenberg bible purchased by the visitors.)

\section{The workflow}
\label{sec:workflow}


It is an old idea of mine to use the fact that for compression
purposes the identical or similar shapes are collected into shape
dictionaries. It seems that this approach, named mixed raster content,
is used now in \acro{JPEG2000}, but the first format to use it successfully
was DjVu.

I designed two tools which are based on this approach. The first one
was a quick and dirty modification of a standard DjVu viewer
(Fig.~\ref{fig:K-C-e}). It was originally implemented by Michał
Rudolf twelve years ago, with important contributions made later
by Alexander
Trufanov.\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/jsbien/djview4shapes}}  It
is quite good for getting a quick overview of the shapes in a
document, but it is not convenient enough for analysing them in
detail.\footnote{When the present paper was almost finished, some
  changes were made to the program which make it much more
  useful.}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{img/lB42}
  \caption{\prname{djview-shapes} and Gutenberg's bible}
  \label{fig:K-C-e}
\end{figure}


The second tool was a sophisticated client-server system. The idea
was that a database will store shapes from different documents
provided by different persons or institutions and accessed remotely by
interested users. The shapes were exported to a My\acro{SQL}
database. Unfortunately the
client\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/jsbien/ndt/wiki/z_shapes}}
was a complete failure, since due to some wrong coding decisions it was
prohibitively slow.  There was neither opportunity nor sufficient
motivation to reimplement it in a better way.

%\cite{bien_repertuar_2020}

So when working on the present paper my main tool was Alexander
Trufanov's \texttt{djvudict}
program\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/trufanov-nok/djvudict}} which
dumps a DjVu shape dictionary in an almost human-readable form, despite
the fact that the program does not seem to be fully reliable (e.g.,
for some not yet known reasons some shapes are skipped).

The first step was accessing the scans of \textit{Polonia
  Typographica} and preparing (with {Gimp}) the images of the
relevant tables. Then the images were converted to DjVu (with
Friedric Foebel's Python~3 fork of
\textsf{didjvu}\tburlfootnote{github.com/FriedrichFroebel/didjvu})
and supplemented by appropriate metadata. Next they were
processed by \textsf{djvudict}. The primary DjVu file names have 
a form like
 \texttt{Augezdecki-01a\_PT08\_403.djvu},
where
\texttt{Augezdecki} is the name of the printer, \texttt{01a} is the font
number sometimes supplemented by a letter, \texttt{PT08} is the
identification of the \textit{Polonia Typographica} fascicule and
\texttt{403} is the plate number (they are numbered continuously in the
whole series; many contain woodcuts of no interest to us).
The
\textsf{djvudict} output is placed in the directories with shorter
names, as in \texttt{Augezdecki-01a}.

A quick and dirty Python program (written, or rather put together from
pieces of code found on the Internet, by myself) converts the
\textsf{djvudict} output to an index for the \textsf{djview4poliqarp}
program (described already in \cite{jsb23} and \cite{Rubricella2023});
the shape identifiers are preserved. The index contains also the
results of \acro{OCR} processing done with \textit{Tesseract}, but at
present, due to
the lack of appropriate training, they are of essentially no use. The files
names are in the form \texttt{Augezdecki-01a.csv}.

The indexes unfortunately require some hand editing with
\textsf{djview4poliqarp}. The first stage is to create an index named
like \texttt{Augezdecki-01a\_tmp.csv}, where the interesting
elements are marked with `\texttt{+}' in the so-called comment field.
Entries are marked with `\texttt{\#}' when
there is a need to adjust the bounding box; it is not yet clear why this
is sometimes needed. Entries marked with `\texttt{\
  \^}' also require adjusting the bounding box, but for a
different reason: the shapes recognized by the DjVu
compression algorithm are just connected components, so diacritics
are usually separate objects.

The files \texttt{*\_tmp.csv} are processed with \textsf{grep} to put
the marked entries into the indexes named \texttt{*\_work.csv}, where
the bounding boxes are adjusted if needed. The files form the basis
for the intermediate brevigraph indexes named \texttt{*\_workbr.csv}
where the entries are supplemented by the brevigraph names.

The brevigraph names serve purely a technical goal: they allow
grouping similar brevigraphs together in the \textsf{djview4poliqarp}
program. However, the choice of the names is not obvious. The official
Unicode names and the Unicode-like \MUFI\ names are cumbersome because
of their length, e.g., \uname{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V WITH DIAGONAL
  STROKE}. As an alternative, I was considering using names derived from
% the \XML\ entity names also provided by \MUFI, for selected pure Unicode
the \XML\ entity names provided by \MUFI, also for selected pure Unicode
characters. Some are short and mnemotechnical, e.g. \verb|&pbardes;|
(\ucode{A751} latin small letter P with stroke, here \uname{BAR}, through
\uname{DES}cender). Some are short and not mnemotechnical, e.g., \verb|&q3app;|
(\ucode{E8B4} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL ET};
\texttt{3} may suggest the shape of the final \textit{et}, but I have
no association to suggest for \texttt{app}), some are mnemotechnical but rather
long, e.g. \verb|&lhighstrok;| (\ucode{A749} latin small letter L with
\uname{HIGH STROK}e).

Nevertheless, after some hesitation, I decided to use those names (with
`\texttt{\&}'
and `\texttt{;}' stripped) for my purposes. The crucial factor in
making this decision was the fact that \textsf{djview4poliqarp} has a
kind of macro facility (Fig.~\ref{fig:abbr}). The configuration
%%% not URL:
file\footnote{\texttt{\char126/.config/djview-poliqarp/djview-poliqarp.conf}} has
an \texttt{[edit]} section which can contain appropriate settings.

For characters which are present neither in Unicode nor in \MUFI\ I use
\textit{ad hoc} names.  Characters which are difficult to
identify I handle in an analogical way. Such names often don't
identify the glyphs uniquely, but merely point to similar glyphs.

For technical reasons the names are placed first in the comment field
and then moved to the entry field with a program.  The final indexes
have the names in the form of \texttt{*\_br.csv}. An aggregated index
is also created which is named simply \texttt{brevigraphs.csv}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{img/shortcuts}
  \caption{Keyboard shortcuts in \textsf{djview4poliqarp}}
  \label{fig:abbr}
\end{figure}



The figures in the present paper were prepared in a way similar to
that used for \cite{Rubricella2023}: a program converts the index of
the selected glyphs into the
\textsf{expex}\tburlfootnote{https://ctan.org/pkg/expex} code and
creates a set of graphic snippets from the DjVu documents.

The glyphs in the figures are numbered for reference purposes and
accompanied by the self-explanatory abbreviations of printing house
names and font numbers.


\section{Non-alphabetic brevigraphs}
\label{sec:non-alph-brev}

Figure \ref{fig:amp} shows ampersand, the brevigraph which in one of
its forms has survived to the present time; it is a very old abbreviation of
the word \textit{et}. It has two forms, both of them are available in
the Junicode family of fonts: \Ju{\&} (\textsf{Junicode-Regular}) and
\iJu{\&} (\textsf{Junicode-Italic}). In computer code the first form
has been available at least since \ASCII\ (\textit{American Standard Code for
  Information Interchange}), which was created in 1963. The Unicode
charts also show only the first form.

\def\CAPTIONamp{Ampersand}
\input amp

\def\CAPTIONet{Tironian note \textit{et}}
\input et



The brevigraph presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:et} is without any doubt the
Tironian note \textit{et} (Tironian notes are named after Tiro, the
secretary of Cicero, who is credited with inventing them), used always as a
separate word. The brevigraph is present in Unicode since version 3.0
(published in 1999) as \ucode{204A} \texttt{TIRONIAN SIGN ET} with the
canonical glyph \Ju{⁊}. The Junicode font has also another variant of
the glyph, namely \Ju{󰀝} (accessed with OpenType character variant
feature or just with the code \ucode{F001D}), which is quite close to
the shape of most glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:et}. Item 31 in the figure
is yet another variant, called in the font manual \textit{Tironian et
  sign later form with bar}; it is available in Junicode with
OpenType feature \textit{ss10} and the tags
{\Ju{\&\_\_a;}}{\Ju{\&\_\_1;}}:
\Ju{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=10}⁊\&\_\_a;\&\_\_2;}.
%\Ju{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=10}\char"204A\char"0E0061\char"0E0032}.

The brevigraph presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:rum} is present in Unicode
since version 5.1.0 (published in 2000) as \ucode{A75D} \uname{LATIN
  SMALL LETTER RUM ROTUNDA} with the canonical glyph \Ju{ꝝ}, which is
quite close to the glyphs in the figure.  It can mean \textit{-rum} or
\textit{-rom}.
Although the name may suggest that this is a variant of the letter
\textit{rum}, their shapes have little in common
(see sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-r}).

As noted in \cite[p.~130]{andre:halshs-00983575}, Unicode has
additionally two similar symbols: \ucode{0264} \uname{JUPITER},
\ucode{1F729} \uname{ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR TIN ORE}. In the Symbola
font these tree characters look like, respectively: \cSgl{ꝝ}, % rum
\cSgl{♃} and % JUPITER
\cSgl{🜩}. They look differently, but this is the decision of the
contemporary font designer. The glyphs listed in Fig.~\ref{fig:rum}
could probably represent any of those three characters; this has to be
checked in the original texts.


\def\CAPTIONrum{The letter \textit{rum} rotunda}
\input rum

All the glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:is} are in my opinion variants of
the character \ucode{A76D} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER IS},
present in Unicode since version 5.1.0 (published in 2000) with the
canonical glyph \Ju{ꝭ}. Of course their usage should be verified in
the original texts.


\def\CAPTIONis{The letter \textit{is}}
\input is



\def\CAPTIONus{The letter \textit{us}}
\input us


The glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:us} looking like the digit \textit{9} are
instances of the well-known brevigraph present in Unicode as
\ucode{A770} \uname{MODIFIER LETTER US} with representative glyph
\Ju{ꝰ}; it was introduced in version 5.1.0 (published in 2008), and
\textit{modifier} means it is not on the baseline. It is used always
at the end of words. The meaning of the glyphs similar to a circle,
like item 43, is to be checked in the texts, as it can be just a
raised small letter \textit{o} (in Unicode, \ucode{1D52}
\uname{MODIFIER LETTER SMALL O}).

The base glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:con}, despite a slightly different
shape, can be identified with the character called by \MUFI\
\uname{LATIN ABBREVIATION SIGN SMALL CON}
\cite[s.~29]{haugen15:_mufi1} and in Unicode unified with \ucode{2184}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED C} with representative glyph
\Ju{ↄ}. As the name suggests, it meaning is just \textit{con} (perhaps
with some exceptions).

As for the letter with diacritics, the situation is much more
complicated. I have not found yet their occurrences in the texts, so I
don't know their meaning. Another problem is the form of the
diacritics. Besides a diaresis, we have the diacritic which seem to be
the same as the one described in \cite{Blake} as \textit{jagged
  horizontal line} which is encoded in Unicode as \ucode {1DD3}
\uname{COMBINING LATIN SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} but
rendered differently: in Junicode it is \Ju{◌ᷓ} and in Symbola it is
\cSgl{◌ᷓ}. Moreover there is an open question what kind of diacritics,
if any, are used in Ungler's font 10 (items 32 and 33).


\def\CAPTIONcon{The letter small \textit{con}}
\input con


\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{b}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-b}


Old texts used many variations of the letter \textit{b}, many of which
are assigned code points by \MUFI.  Many variants of the letter
\textit{b} are also listed in \textit{Polonia Typographica}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:b} presents those instances which are directly relevant to
our purposes here.

\def\CAPTIONb{The variants of the letter \textit{b}}
\input b

We will focus on item 3 (Haller's font no 4) and those from
Hochfeder's fonts, items 8--17, as their shapes seem to be carefully
designed while other items seem to be just more or less crude variations
of those.

  \label{fig:Gabbr}
\end{figure}


A character with an almost identical shape appeared already in
Gutenberg's 42-line bible. Despite this, it seems it still has no
name and even no generally accepted description. In
\cite[p.~12]{andre15:B42} Jacques André proposes the name
\textit{latin small letter b with flourish} (he considers also an
alternative \textit{latin small letter b ligated with arm of latin
  small r}, but cf.\ sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-h}).


According to Gerald Bettridge \cite{Bettridge}, it means \textit{bis}
% why left?
%and, after the long \textit{s}, \textit{ub} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Gabbr}, left,
and, after the long \textit{s}, \textit{ub} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:Gabbr},
also \cite[p.~12]{andre15:B42} and
\cite[p.~12]{andre22:_inven_unicod_mufi}). It can be ligated with long
\textit{s}; see sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-long-1}.

It seems this was not always
a brevigraph, sometimes it is just equivalent to a normal \textit{b}
\cite[p.~8]{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog}. Or perhaps it was
just a printer's mistake?

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{d}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-d}

\def\CAPTIONd{The variants of the letter \textit{d}}
\input d

The similarity of items 6 and (e.g.)\ 19 to item 3 from
Fig.~\ref{fig:b} and items 5 and (e.g.)\ 8 from Fig.~\ref{fig:h},
all from respectively the same fonts, seems to be a design decision.

I think this is the brevigraph called \textit{d with two ascenders}
by Erin Blake in \cite{Blake}; she states that the brevigraph stands
for
\begin{quote}
  \textit{de} and (depending on the language) also for \textit{der},
  \textit{dis}, \textit{dum} and other \textit{d}-syllables
\end{quote}

It is an open question whether it should be identified with a
character having a similar appearance in Gutenberg's bible.  The
character is actually the letter \textit{d} with a diacritical
mark.\footnote{In \cite{andre15:B42} it is identified with
  \ucode{1E0B} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH DOT ABOVE} (\Ju{ḋ})}
According to Gerald Bettridge \cite{Bettridge}, the character appears
there with several meanings.

Peter
Baker suggested\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/133}}
treating the character as \MUFI\ \ucode{F159} \uname{LATIN
  ABBREVIATION SIGN SMALL DE} (\Ju{}), called also \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LETTER D ROTUNDA WITH
  BAR}.\tburlfootnote{https://mufi.info/q.php?p=mufi/chars/unichar/61785}
He also points to another similar \MUFI\ character, namely \ucode{EBB2}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER D ROTUNDA WITH ACUTE} \Ju{}.

The meaning of the brevigraph with a dot above is yet to be checked in the
texts.

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{e}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-e-2}

\def\CAPTIONe{The variants of the letter \textit{e}}
\input e

Fig.~\ref{fig:e} presents the well-known \textit{e caudata}, meaning
\textit{ae}.  

It is an open controversy whether \textit{e caudata} and the
contemporary \ucode{0119} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH OGONEK}
should be considered the same character. Peter Baker
wrote\tburlfootnote{{https://junicode.sourceforge.net/ecaudata.html}}
\begin{quote}
  Perhaps it is time to admit that the Latinate cauda and the ogonek
  used by Polish and other languages are different beasts.
\end{quote}
and provided an OpenType feature (\textsl{ss15}) to distinguish them
in the Junicode
font. 
% not needed:
% \tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/issues/13}}
I have no opinion on this matter.

The meaning of the letter with a bar above (item 19) is yet to be checked in the
texts.

\section{Modification of the letter \textit{g}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-g}

\def\CAPTIONg{The variants of the letter \textit{g}}
\input g

I have little to say about the glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:g}, since I
have not found any occurrence of them in a text. On one hand they resemble
the letters \textit{rum} (sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-r}), and
\textit{tum} (sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-t}). On the other hand it
resemble also the glyph from Fig.~\ref{fig:cis}. Moreover Blake
\cite{Blake} says that \textit{weird vertical line at end of word}
means an \textit{s} preceded by a vowel (typically \textit{es} in
English and \textit{is} in Latin); in other words in Latin it can be
perhaps considered as the ligature of \textit{g} and the letter
%`\textit{is}' has been discussed already in sec.~\ref{sec:non-alph-brev}.
`\textit{is}' which has been discussed already in sec.~\ref{sec:non-alph-brev}.

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{h}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-h}

For some fonts there is an evident similarity of items among
Figures \ref{fig:b}, \ref{fig:d}, and~\ref{fig:h}. It seems to
be a design decision.

\def\CAPTIONh{The variants of the letter \textit{h}}
\input h

A character with an almost identical shape appeared in Gutenberg's
42-line bible. In the \MUFI\ recommendation, it is identified as
\ucode{E8C3} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER B LIGATED WITH ARM OF LATIN SMALL
LETTER R} (\Ju{}). Jacques André
\cite[p.~17]{andre15:B42} notes that the name is strange and I agree
with him.

% s. 41 B42 ?

The glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:h} seem to be the same as those described
as \textit{h with a tick on top} by Blake, who states
\begin{quote}
  Stands for \textit{h}-syllables like \textit{han}, \textit{het}, and
  \textit{hic}
\end{quote}

Another interpretation was presented by Lisa Howarth on the Facebook
The Paleography Society
group:\tbsurlfootnote{facebook.com/groups/7687162686/permalink/10158299890607687}
\begin{quote}
  When attached to an `h', it usually means `er' or `ab' depending on the word
\end{quote}
She considers the glyph to be composed from the letter \textit{h} and
an diacritical sign, similar to Peter
Baker, who identifies%

the diacritics as \ucode{0335} \uname{COMBINING SHORT
  STROKE OVERLAY} (\Ju{◌̵}). 

\section{The modification of the letter \textit{l}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-l}


\def\CAPTIONl{The variants of the letter \textit{l}}
\input l

Reportedly the glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:l} have the same meaning as
\ucode {A749} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH HIGH STROKE} (\Ju{ꝉ})
and therefore a separate code point has not been
assigned.\tburlfootnote{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/issues/4} However
the Junicode font contains at code point \ucode{F000F} the glyph
\textit{l with high stroke ending with flourish}
(\Ju{󰀏\tubthinnerspace}), accessible
also as \textit{l} with the OpenType feature \textsf{ss10} and the
tags {\Ju{\&\_\_s;}}{\Ju{\&\_\_f;}}.

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{p}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-p}

\def\CAPTIONpbardes{The letter \textit{p} with stroke}
\input pbardes


Fig.~\ref{fig:pbardes} contains the variants of a well-known brevigraph,
available in Unicode since version 5.1.0 (published in 2008)
as \ucode{A751} \uname{LATIN LETTER P WITH STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER}
with representative glyph \Ju{ꝑ}.  The brevigraph is ambiguous;
the most popular meanings are \textit{per}, \textit{par} and
\textit{por}. It can be used as an individual word or as a prefix.


\def\CAPTIONpflour{The letter \textit{p} with flourish}
\input pflour


The base characters in Fig.~\ref{fig:pflour} are also the variants of a
well-known brevigraph, available in Unicode since version
5.1.0 (published in 2008) as \ucode{A753} \uname{LATIN LETTER P WITH
FLOURISH} with representative glyph \Ju{ꝓ}.  The brevigraph
is ambiguous; the most popular meanings are \textit{pro} and
\textit{por}. It too can be used as an individual word or as a prefix.


The last characters are included in the \MUFI\ recommendation as
\ucode{EED7} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE PP WITH FLOURISH} with the
glyph \Ju{}; the meaning is \textit{prop-}.

The meaning of the characters with diacritics is yet to be checked in
the texts. 

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{q}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-q}


\def\CAPTIONqbardes{The letter \textit{q} with stroke through descender}
\input qbardes

The glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:qbardes} represent a well-known
brevigraph, included in Unicode since version 5.1.0
(published in 2008) as \ucode{A757} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH
  STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER} with representative glyph \Ju{ꝗ}.  It
can be used as an individual word or as part of it and is quite
ambiguous; the reported meanings are \textit{quam}, \textit{que},
\textit{quan-} and
\hbox{\textit{qui-}}.

\def\CAPTIONqslstrok{The letter \textit{q} with diagonal stroke}
\input qslstrok

Fig.~\ref{fig:qbardes} demonstrates also various kinds of
% a typo
diacritical marks which can be used with this brevigraph. The meaning
of modified brevigraphs is not clear and requires further
research.


The characters in Fig.~\ref{fig:qslstrok} are in my opinion
variants of the brevigraph introduced to Unicode in version 5.1.0
(published 2008) as \ucode{A759} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH
  DIAGONAL STROKE} with representative glyph \Ju{ꝙ}, although such
a classification of some shapes is questionable.  The Unicode name is
not very adequate; in \cite[p.~70]{andre22:_inven_unicod_mufi} the
name \uname{latin small letter q with swash} is proposed.  The
brevigraph has three meanings: \textit{quod}, \textit{qui} and
\textit{que}; it can be used as an individual word or as a part of it.

The meaning of modified brevigraphs with diacritical marks is not
clear. Here we will mention only that in
\cite[p.~71]{andre22:_inven_unicod_mufi} a glyph similar to those from
Fig.~\ref{fig:qslstrok} is classified as \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER
  Q WITH SWASH AND LATIN SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} (an
alternative name \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH FLOURISH \ldots}\ is
also considered), and an example is given where the brevigraph means
\textit{quan-}.

\def\CAPTIONqet{The letter \textit{q} with final \textit{et}}
\input qet

The glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:qet} represent the brevigraph
assigned the Private Use Area code \ucode{E8BF} and the name
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL ET} by \MUFI\ in
version~4 of the recommendation \cite[p.~81]{haugen15:_mufi1}. In the
Junicode font, it is rendered as \Ju{}.

Finding the meaning of the brevigraph with a diacritical mark requires
additional research, but we will note that according to
\cite{Blake} some of the glyphs from Fig.~\ref{fig:qet} mean
\textit{quam} or \textit{quan}.

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{r}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-r}



\def\CAPTIONrrum{The alternative glyphs of the letter \textit{rum}}
\input rrum


The first glyph in Fig.~\ref{fig:rrum} is an interesting and rather
little-known character. Although this is far from obvious, it is
\ucode{A775} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER RUM} despite the fact that the
Unicode representative glyph is `\cSgl{ꝵ}', as in Junicode we have
\Ju{ꝵ}\Dash the glyph is practically identical to that on the figure. The
character was added to Unicode in version 5.1 (published in
2008), along with some similar characters
(see sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-t}). I assume the second glyph in the
figure is just a variant of the first one.

\def\CAPTIONresp{The alternative glyphs of the letter \textit{response}}
\input resp


The glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:resp} are ambiguous.  They can represent
\ucode{A776} \uname{LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL RUM}
% color
(\cSgl{ꝶ}), but
they can also be interpreted as \ucode{211E} \uname{PRESCRIPTION TAKE}
(\Ju{℞}) and, last but not least, \ucode{211F} \uname{RESPONSE}
(\Ju{℞}) which in prayer books can be paired with the \textit{versicle}
character (see sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-v}).


\section{Modifications of the letter long \textit{s}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-long-1}

\def\CAPTIONslongflour{Long \textit{s} with flourish}
\input slongflour


The glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:slongflour} are noted in the \MUFI\
recommendations as \mcode{E8B7} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S WITH
  FLOURISH}~(\Ju{}).


The glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:slonget} are present neither in Unicode
nor in the \MUFI\ recommendation, but they are obviously the long
\textit{s} (\ucode{017F}) ligated with the final \textit{et}
(\ucode{A76B}). As far as I know, this ligature is available only in
the Junicode
font\tburlfootnote{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/140}
with the Historic Ligature (\textit{hlig}) feature:
\Ju{\addfontfeature{Ligatures=Historic}ſꝫ}.
%\newcommand{\hlig}[1]{{\addfontfeature{Ligatures=Historic}#1}}
The meaning is \textit{sed}, as exemplified in \cite[example
(68)]{Rubricella2023errata}.

\def\CAPTIONslonget{Long \textit{s} with final \textit{et}}
\input slonget

\def\CAPTIONslongx{Long \textit{s} with final \textit{et}?}
\input slongx

Fig.~\ref{fig:slongx} shows a problematic glyph which I'm not sure how
to interpret.


\def\CAPTIONslongb{The ligature of long \textit{s} with the letter
  \textit{b} and its modifications} \input slongb

One of the component characters of the ligatures presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:slongb} has been already mentioned in
sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-b}. We see also the letter \textit{b} with a
dot above; the meaning of the letter, ligated or not, is yet to be
investigated.

  It is worth noting that in item 18 instead of a normal long
  \textit{s} we have a \uname{LONG FUNNY S} proposed to be included in
  the \MUFI\ recommendation.\tburlfootnote{https://mufi.info/q.php?p=mufi/chars/unichar/1048876}
  
  \def\CAPTIONslongl{The ligature of long \textit{s} with 
   the letter \textit{l} with flourish?}
 \input slongl

 In Fig.~\ref{fig:slongl} we have a ligature which can be perhaps
 treated as a variant of \MUFI\ \ucode{E8AF} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE
   LONG S L WITH DIAGONAL STROKE} (\Ju{}).

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{t}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-t}

\def\CAPTIONtum{The letter \textit{tum}}
\input tum

Fig.~\ref{fig:tum} shows the rather rare brevigraph
\ucode{A777} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER TUM} with representative
glyph \Ju{ꝷ}.  It was introduced in version 5.1 (published in 2008),
together with some related letters such as \ucode{A775} \uname{LATIN
  SMALL LETTER RUM} (see sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-r}).

\section{Modification of the letter v}
\label{sec:modif-lett-v}

\def\CAPTIONv{The letter \textit{v} with diagonal stroke} \input v

The primary interpretation of the glyphs in Fig.~\ref{fig:v} seems to
be \ucode{A75F} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER V WITH DIAGONAL STROKE}
(\Ju{ꝟ}) added to Unicode in version 5.1.0 (published in 2008); in
item 14 it is the other arm which is crossed.  It means \textit{ver}
or \textit{vir}.

The glyphs can stand also for \ucode{2123} \uname{VERSICLE} (\Ju{℣}),
used to mark in the prayer books the beginning of a versicle, i.e.,  a
short sentence said or sung by the minister in a church service, to
which the congregation gives a response.\footnote{Definition
  provided by Google in a non-linkable form.}


\section{Final remarks}
\label{sec:final-remarks}

As has already been mentioned, the next step should be to find the
occurrences of the discussed brevigraphs in the texts and in this way
find or verify their meaning. For this, we don't need the full
transcriptions of the texts.  What is sufficient for our purposes is
\textit{glyph} or \textit{character} \textit{spotting}. These tasks
are discussed in some publications, but there seems to be no tool
available directly for use. With some limitations, a variant of a
workflow described earlier can be used for this purpose. The
\textsf{djvudict} output can be converted to a \PDF\ document (created
with \TeX{}) with enlarged glyphs which make relatively easy to
search for interesting items and to note their identifiers
(Fig.~\ref{fig:page}). Additionally, an \textsf{djview4poliqarp}
index can be created, which uses the shape identifier as the
searchable entry fields (Fig.~\ref{fig:cis1}).  The identifiers are
not unique, nevertheless it is possible with some effort to find the
context of a shape in the document, as illustrated in Figures
\ref{fig:page} and \ref{fig:cis1} (note the shape
\texttt{01344}).

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption{The \textsf{djvudict} output in the form of a \textsf{djview4poliqarp} index}
  \label{fig:cis1}
\end{figure}

At present my programs supporting this approach are too primitive to
be used conveniently, but I will try to improve them.  Any help from
Python and/or \acro{QT} programmers (\acro{QT} was used to implement
% font
\textsf{djview4poliqarp} and \textsf{djview4shapes}) would be
welcomed and appreciated.
