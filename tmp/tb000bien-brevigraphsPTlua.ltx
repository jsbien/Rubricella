\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% The paper is a follow up of my earlier papers, namely
% \cite{bień21:_trakt_stanis_zabor},
% \cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog} and \cite{Rubricella2023}, but
% it uses a different approach. 

The fonts of the several 16th century printers active in Poland,
namely Aleksander Augezdecki, Jan Haller, Kasper Hochfeder, Florian
Ungler (the first and second printing house) and Maciej Wirzbięta, has
been described in the series of 12 fascicules entitled \textit{Polonia
  {Typographica} {Saeculi} {Sedecimi}} published in years
1959--1981\footnote{The first two fascicules were published in 1936
  and 1937, but we are interested in their second revised editions
  because they were supplemented by the character set tables.}. Almost
all of them are digitized but
  % , to
  % avoid the risk of infringing the copyright which for this
  % publication is rather unclear,
available only for ``digital lending'' in
ACADEMICA\footnote{\textit{Interlibrary loan system of books and
    scientific publications}: \url{https://academica.edu.pl/}}
because, I guess, it's not clear who owns the copyright as this was a
collaborative effort of several persons (only one contributor is still
alive) and institutions.
% To save the
% space I don't give the bibliographic details here.

In the fascicules every font is illustrated by an excerpt of a text
and sometimes
% .  %The fonts discussed in
% \cite{bułhak:_pierw_florian_ungler1} and %
% \cite{bułhak:_drug_florian_ungler2}.  are
additionally by a table of character set, an example of such a table
is presented on Fig. \ref{fig:table16}.  Most of the tables has been
prepared by Maria Błońska with some help of Anna Wolińska and Henryk
Bułhak (the editor of several fascicules), some tables were prepared
also by Anna Śliwa, Alodia Kawecka Gryczowa (the editor of several
fascicules) and Paulina Buchwald-Pelcowa (the editor of the whole
series).  The number of font tables is 76 and the total number of
glyphs in the tables is over 6 hundred. Unfortunately I missed the
opportunity to get the first-hand information how the tables were
prepared when talking by phone with Paulina Buchwald-Pelcowa in 2022
(she died two years later). Some rudimentary information I got from
Henryk Bułhak, also in phone calls, but he was able to provide me only
with a rather general information: the glyphs were cut out with a
razor blade from photocopies and pasted together. This information
seems relevant because it shows what kind of mistakes can be expected
in the tables: if a character occurs in a table then it can be
displaced or misassigned (cf. sec. \ref{sec:modif-lett-g}), but
definitely exists in a text, on the other hand some omissions are
possible. For example, the glyph on Fig.~\ref{fig:cis} is not listed
in the table on Fig.~\ref{fig:table16}, but can be found in the texts
printed reportedly with this font; according to Peter Baker the
meaning is
\textit{cis}\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/255}}.

\end{figure}



No comments to the tables are provided, but the order of glyphs is
sometimes relevant for their interpretation, cf. Fig~\ref{fig:ghi},
\ref{fig:cec} and \ref{fig:ghhi}.

\end{figure}

  \caption{A fragment of Plate 411. The third glyph is interpreted as

    table.}
  \label{fig:ghhi}
\end{figure}

The quality of the glyph images is sometimes
quite low, I understand no better samples were available.

Early prints used a lot of abbreviations which where the descendants
of the abbreviations used in manuscripts; we discuss here a subset of
them called brevigraphs. Quite often they consisted of a regular
non-modified letter supplemented by a diacritical mark, usually a
macron or a similar glyph, placed above. It is natural to call them
composed brevigraphs. On the other hand there are abbreviations in a
shape of a modified letter or a letter-like symbol; we call them basic
brevigraphs even if they are accompanied by a diacritical mark.

The work described here consisted primarily in creating computer
indexes allowing to compare similar characters from the same or
different fonts, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:index1}. The indexes and other
resources are available in a public
repository\tburlfootnote{https://github.com/jsbien/early_fonts_inventory};
the repository site contains \textit{Issues} and \textit{Discussions}
tabs which allow to report mistakes and provide comments.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/compare}
  \caption{Comparing characters with \textsf{djview4poliqarp}}
  \label{fig:index1}
\end{figure}


The paper is considered a progress report for two reasons. First, the
character indexes should be supplemented by indexes showing their
meaning and their use in texts, in a similar way as described in
\cite{jsb23}.  Secondly, I omitted some interesting glyphs because I
was not sure how to interpret them. An example is presented on
Fig.~\ref{fig:hhh}: is the last but one glyph a modification of the
letter \textit{h} or is this just the letter \textit{h} with a
diacritic mark which happens to touch the letter?


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[height=5ex]{img/h_Hochfeder-03}
  \caption{A fragment of Plate 21.  Is the last but one glyph a basic
    brevigraph?}
  \label{fig:hhh}
\end{figure}


The obvious question for every basic brevigraph is whether it has been
assigned a codepoint in the Unicode
standard\tburlfootnote{https://home.unicode.org/}.  Checking the
character charts is unfortunately not sufficient for two
reasons. First, the character name is not intended to provide the full
information about the character, it should be treated as a more or
less arbitrary label. Secondly, in principle (the practise is
sometimes questionable) the standard defines characters, not glyphs,
and the glyph in a chart is only one of the possible representations
of the character (an example is given in
sections~\ref{sec:modif-lett-l}). In consequence it is useful to look
up also the character proposals and related documents in the Unicode
Technical Committee Document Registry
\tburlfootnote{http://unicode.org/L2/} (a similar resource is the
ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2
register\tbsurlfootnote{https://www.unicode.org/wg2/}). It is also
useful to look for alternative glyphs in specialized fonts,
cf. sections \ref{sec:modif-lett-r}.

Another interesting question is whether the brevigraph has been
assigned a codepoint in the Unicode Private Use Area by Medieval
Unicode Font Initiative\tburlfootnote{https://mufi.info/}. The MUFI
assignments at first, up to version 4.0, were published as the
recommendations in the form of PDF documents, cf.
\cite{haugen15:_mufi1}, they list over 1500 pure Unicode and Private
Use Area characters in the Latin alphabet of potential use for the
encoding old text sources.
%  \tburlfootnote{https://www.menota.org/HB2_A_characters.xml}.

  Now the recommendations have the form of a database which can be
  browsed online, cf. Fig. \ref{fig:MUFI}. Since some time a subset of
  the data content is available for download on the Creative Commons
  Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license in the form of a CSV or Jason
  file.
  % Some useful resources, e.g. the list of the XML entities, can

\end{figure}

Last but not least, it is important whether a brevigraph can be
rendered adequatly by a font.  Our primary focus is on Peter Baker's
Junicode Two font, as it is available on a free
license\tbsurlfootnote{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font} and
contains some characters not available elsewhere,
cf. \cite{bien_representing_2022}. However we use also George Douros'
Symbola font\tburlfootnote{https://dn-works.com/ufas/} when we need a
character not available in Junicode.

It is also worth mentioning that some of the brevigraphs discussed
here has been already used in Gutenberg's bibles. The character set of
these books has been the subject of several publication, they are
referenced in \cite{andre15:B42} and
\cite{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog}.  I found also very useful the
unpublished text \cite{Bettridge} provided to me kindly by the author
(it is attached by the Printing Museum in Lyon to digital copies of a
folio of the Gutenberg Bible purchased by the visitors).

\section{The workflow}
\label{sec:workflow}


It is an old idea of mine to use the fact that for the compression
purpose the identical or similar shapes are collected into the shape
dictionaries. It seems that this approach, named mixed raster content,
is used now in JPEG2000, but the first format to use it succesfully
was DjVu.

I designed two tools which are based on this approach. The first one
was a quick and dirty modification of a standard DjVu viewer,
cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:K-C-e}. It was originally implemented by Michał
Rudolf twelve years ago, some important contributions were made later
by Alexander
Trufanov\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/jsbien/djview4shapes}}.  It
is quite good for getting a quick overview of the shapes in a
document, but it is not convenient enough for analysing them in
detail\footnote{When the present paper was almost finished, some
  changes has been made to the program which make it much more
  useful.}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/lB42}
  \caption{\prname{djview-shapes} and Gutenberg's bible}
  \label{fig:K-C-e}
\end{figure}


The second tool was a sophisticated client-server system. The idea
was that a data base will store shapes from different documents
provided by different persons or institutions and accessed remotely by
interested users. The shapes were exported to a MySQL
database. Unfortunately the
client\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/jsbien/ndt/wiki/z_shapes}}
was a complete failure, as due to some wrong coding decisions it was
prohibitively slow.  There was neither opportunity nor sufficient
motivation to reimplement it in a better way.

%\cite{bien_repertuar_2020}

So when working on the present paper my main tool was Alexander
Trufanov's \texttt{djvudict}
program\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/trufanov-nok/djvudict}} which
dump a DjVu shape dictionary in an almost human readable form, despite
the fact that the program does not seem to be fully reliable (e.g.
for some not yet known reasons some shapes are skipped).

The first step was of course accessing the scans of \textit{Polonia
  Typographica} and preparing (with \textsf{Gimp}) the images of the
relevant tables. Then the images has been converted to DjVu (with
Friedric Foebel's Python~3 fork of
\textsf{didjvu}\tburlfootnote{github.com/FriedrichFroebel/didjvu})
and supplemented by appropriate metadata. Next they have been
processed by \textsf{djvudict}. The primary DjVu file names has the
form exemplified by
 \texttt{Augezdecki-01a\_PT08\_403.djvu},
where
\texttt{Augezdecki} in the printer name, \texttt{01a} is the font
number sometimes suplemented by a letter, \texttt{PT08} is the
identification of the \textit{Polonia Typographica} fascicule and
\texttt{403} is the plate number (they are numbered continuosly in the
whole series, a lot of them contain woodcuts of no interest to us).
The
\textsf{djvudict} output is placed in the directories with shorter
names, exemplified by \texttt{Augezdecki-01a}.

A quick and dirty Python program (written, or rather put together from
pieces of code found on the Internet, by myself) convert the
\textsf{djvudict} output to an index for the \textsf{djview4poliqarp}
program (described already in \cite{jsb23} and \cite{Rubricella2023});
the shape identifiers are preserved. The index contains also the
results of OCR made with \textit{Tesseract}, but at present, due to
the lack of appropriate training, they are rather of no use. The files
names are in the form \texttt{Augezdecki-01a.csv}

The indexes require unfortunately some hand editing with
\textsf{djview4poliqarp}. The first stage is to create the index named
in the form \texttt{Augezdecki-01a\_tmp.csv} where the interesting
elements are marked with `\texttt{+}' in the so called comment field;
moreover some entries are marked with `\texttt{\#}' which means that
there is a need to adjust the bounding box; it is not yet clear why it
is sometimes needed. Moreover some entries are marked with `\texttt{\
  \^}', they also require adjusting the bounding box, but for a
different reason: the shapes recognized by the \textsf{DjVu}
compression algorithm are just connecting components, so diacritics
are usually separate objects.

The files \texttt{*\_tmp.csv} are processed with \textsf{grep} to put
the marked entries into the indexes named \texttt{*\_work.csv}, where
the bounding boxes are adjusted if needed. The files form the basis
for the intermediate brevigraphs indexes named \texttt{*\_workbr.csv}
where the entries are supplemented by the brevigraphs names.

The brevigraph names serve purely a technical goal, they allow to
group the similar brevigraphs together in the \textsf{djview4poliqarp}
program. However the choice of the names is not obvious. The official
Unicode names and the Unicode-like MUFI names are cumbersome because
of their length, e.g. \uname{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V WITH DIAGONAL
  STROKE}. In consequence I was considering using names derived from
the XML entity names provided by MUFI also for selected pure Unicode
characters. Some are short and mnemotechnical, e.g. \verb|&pbardes;|
(\ucode{A751} latin small letter P with stroke, here BAR, through
DEScender). Some are short and not mnemotechnical, e.g. \verb|&q3app;|
(\ucode{E8B4} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL ET};
\texttt{3} may suggest the shape of the final \textit{et}, but I have
no association with \texttt{app}), some are mnemotechnical but rather
long, e.g. \verb|&lhighstrok;| (\ucode{A749} latin small letter L with
HIGH STROKe).

After some hesitation I decided to use those names (with `\texttt{\&}'
and `\texttt{;}' stripped) for my purposes. The crucial factor in
making the decision was the fact that \textsf{djview4poliqarp} has a
kind of macro facility, cf. Fig. \ref{fig:abbr}. The configuration
file\tburlfootnote{~/.config/djview-poliqarp/djview-poliqarp.conf} has
the \texttt{[edit]} section which can contain appropriate settings.

For characters which are present neither in Unicode nor in MUFI I use
some \textit{ad hoc} names; the character which are difficult to
identify I handle in an analogical way. Such names often don't
identify the glyphs uniqually, they just point to similar glyphs.

For technical reasons the names are placed first in the comment field
and then moved to the entry field with a program.  The final indexes
have the names in the form of \texttt{*\_br.csv}. An aggregated index
is also created which is named simply \texttt{brevigraphs.cvs}.

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{img/shortcuts}
  \caption{Keyboard shorcuts in \textsf{djview4poliqarp}}
  \label{fig:abbr}
\end{figure}



The figures in the present paper were prepared in a way similar to
that used for \cite{Rubricella2023}: a program converts the index of
the selected glyphs into the
\textsf{expex}\tburlfootnote{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/expex} code and
creates a set of graphic snippets from the DjVu documents.
% At first the exhaustive figures were
% prepared which presented the brevigraph images from all the ???  fonts
% under consideration. The ???-page paper containing them is available
% in the repository. For the present paper some figures has been
% simplified to save the space.

The glyphs in the figures are numbered for reference purposes and
accompanied by the self-explanatory abbreviations of printing house
names and font numbers.


\section{Non-alphabetic brevigraphs}
\label{sec:non-alph-brev}

The Fig.~\ref{fig:amp} shows ampersand, the brevigraph which in one of
its form survived to present time; it is a very old abbreviation of
the word \textit{et}. It has two forms, both of them are available in
the Junicode family of fonts: \Ju{\&} (\textsf{Junicode-Regular}) and
\iJu{\&} (\textsf{Junicode-Italic}). In computer code the first form
is available at least since ASCII (\textit{American Standard Code for
  Intermation Interchage}), which was created in 1963. The Unicode
charts also show only the first form.

\def\CAPTIONamp{Ampersand}
\input amp


The brevigraph presented on Fig. \ref{fig:et} is without any doubt the
Tironian note \textit{et} (Tironian notes are named after Tiro, the
secretary of Cicero, who is credited to invent them), used always as a
separate word. The brevigraph is present in Unicode since verion 3.0
(published in 1999) as \ucode{204A} \texttt{TIRONIAN SIGN ET} with the
canonical glyph \Ju{⁊}. The Junicode font has also another variant of
the glyph, namely \Ju{󰀝} (accessed with OpenType character variant
feature or just with the code \ucode{F001D}), which is quite close to
the shape of most glyphs on Fig. \ref{fig:et}. Item 31 on the figure
is yet another variant, called in the font manual \textit{Tironian et
  sign later form with bar}; it is available in Junicode only with
OpenType feature \textit{ss10} and the tags
{\Ju{\&\_\_a;}}{\Ju{\&\_\_1;}}:
\Ju{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=10}⁊\&\_\_a;\&\_\_2;}.
%\Ju{\addfontfeature{StylisticSet=10}\char"204A\char"0E0061\char"0E0032}.

\def\CAPTIONet{Tironian note \textit{et}}
\input et


The brevigraph presented on Fig. \ref{fig:rum} is present in Unicode
since version 5.1.0 (published in 2000) as \ucode{A75D} \uname{LATIN
  SMALL LETTER RUM ROTUNDA} with the canonical glyph \Ju{ꝝ}, which is
quite close to the glyphs on the figure.  It can mean \textit{-rum} or
\textit{-rom}.

Although the name may suggest that this is a variant of the letter
\textit{rum}, their shapes have little in common,
cf. sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-r}.

As noted in \cite[p.~130]{andre:halshs-00983575}, Unicode has
additionally two similar symbols: \ucode{0264} \uname{JUPITER},
\ucode{1F729} \uname{ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR TIN ORE}. In the Symbola
font all the tree characters look respectively as: \cSgl{ꝝ}, % rum
\cSgl{♃} and % JUPITER
\cSgl{🜩}. They look differently, but this is the decision of the
contemporary font designer. The glyphs listed on Fig.~\ref{fig:rum}
probably could represent any of those three characters, this is to be
checked in the original texts.


\def\CAPTIONrum{The letter \textit{rum} rotunda}
\input rum

All the glyphs on Fig. \ref{fig:is} are in my opinion the variants of
the character \ucode{A76D} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER IS}, which is
present in Unicode since version 5.1.0 (published in 2000) with the
canonical glyph \Ju{ꝭ}. Of course their usage should be verified in
the original texts.


\def\CAPTIONis{The letter \textit{is}}
\input is



The glyphs on Fig. \ref{fig:us} looking like the digit \textit{9} are
the instances of the well known brevigraph present in Unicode as
\ucode{A770} \uname{MODIFIER LETTER US} with the representative glyph
\Ju{ꝰ}; it was introduced in version 5.1.0 (published in 2008),
\textit{modifier} means it is not on the baseline. It is used always
at the end of words. The meaning of the glyphs similar to a circle,
like item 43, is to be checked in the texts, as it can be just a
raised small letter \textit{o}, in Unicode \ucode{1D52}
\uname{MODIFIER LETTER SMALL O}.


\def\CAPTIONus{The letter \textit{us}}
\input us


The base glyphs on Fig. \ref{fig:con}, despite a slightly different
shape, can be identified with the character called by MUFI
\uname{LATIN ABBREVIATION SIGN SMALL CON}
\cite[s. 29]{haugen15:_mufi1} and in Unicode unified with \ucode{2184}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER REVERSED C} with the representative glyph
\Ju{ↄ}. As the name suggests, it meaning is just \textit{con} (perhaps
with some exceptions).

As for the letter with diacritics, the situation is much more
complicated. I have not found yet their occurrences in the texts, so I
don't know their meaning. Another problem is the form of the
diacritics. Besides a diaresis, we have the diacritic which seem to be
the same as the one described in \cite{Blake} as \textit{jagged
  horizontal line} which is encoded in Unicode as \ucode {1DD3}
\uname{COMBINING LATIN SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} but
rendered differently: in Junicode is it \Ju{◌ᷓ} and in Symbola it is
\cSgl{◌ᷓ}. Moreover there is an open question what kind of diacritics,
if any, is used in Ungler's font 10 (items 32 and 33).


\def\CAPTIONcon{The letter small \textit{con}}
\input con


\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{b}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-b}


Old texts used many variations of the letter \textit{b}, many of them
are assigned code points by MUFI.  Many variants of the letter
\textit{b} are also listed in \textit{Polonia Typographica},
Fig.~\ref{fig:b} presents those of them which are directly relevant to
our purpose.

\def\CAPTIONb{The variants of the letter \textit{b}}
\input b

We will focus on item 3 (Haller's font no 4) and those from
Hochfeder's fonts like item 8-17, as their shapes seem to be carefully
designed while other items seem to be just more or less crude versions
of it.

\end{figure}


The character with the almost identical shape appeared already in
Gutenberg's 42-line Bible. Despite of this it seems it still has no
name and even no generally accepted description. In
\cite[p.~12]{andre15:B42} Jacques André proposes the name
\textit{latin small letter b with flourish} (he considers also an
alternative one \textit{latin small letter b ligated with arm of latin
  small r}, but cf. sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-h}).


According to Gerald Bettridge \cite{Bettridge} it means \textit{bis}
and, after the long \textit{s}, \textit{ub}, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:Gabbr};
cf. also \cite[p.~12]{andre15:B42} and
\cite[p.~12]{andre22:_inven_unicod_mufi}; it can be ligated with long
\textit{s}, cf. sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-long-1}.

 Looks like it not always is
a brevigraph, sometimes it is just equivalent to a normal \textit{b},
cf.~\cite[p.~8]{bień21:_reper_ungler_polon_typog} (or perhaps it was
just a printer's mistake?).

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{d}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-d}

\def\CAPTIONd{The variants of the letter \textit{d}}
\input d

The similarity of item 6 and e.g. 19 to the item 3 from the
Fig.~\ref{fig:b} and the item 5 and e.g. 8 from the Fig. ~\ref{fig:h},
all from respectively the same fonts, seems to be a design decision.

According to Gerald Bettridge \cite{Bettridge} the character also
appears in Gutenberg's bible with several meanings\footnote{It is not
  confirmed by \cite{andre15:B42}, perhaps the author was analizing a
  different edition.}. On the other hand the brevigraph is called
\textit{d with two ascenders} by Erin Blake in \cite{Blake}; he states
that the brevigraph stands for
\begin{quote}
  \textit{de} and (depending on the language) also for \textit{der},
  \textit{dis}, \textit{dum} and other \textit{d}-syllables
\end{quote}


Peter
Baker\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/133}}
suggest to treat the character as MUFI \ucode{F159} \uname{LATIN
  ABBREVIATION SIGN SMALL DE} (\Ju{}), called also \uname{LATIN SMALL
  LETTER D ROTUNDA WITH
  BAR}\tburlfootnote{https://mufi.info/q.php?p=mufi/chars/unichar/61785}.
He also points to another similar MUFI character, namely \ucode{EBB2}
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER D ROTUNDA WITH ACUTE} \Ju{}.

The meaning of the brevigraph with a dot above is yet to checked in the
texts.

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{e}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-e-2}

\def\CAPTIONe{The variants of the letter \textit{e}}
\input e

Fig.~\ref{fig:e} presents the well known \textit{e caudata} meaning
\textit{ae}.  

It is an open controversy whether \textit{e caudata} and the
contemporary \ucode{0119} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH OGONEK}
should be considered the same character. Peter Baker
wrote\tburlfootnote{{http://junicode.sourceforge.net/ecaudata.html}}
\begin{quote}
  Perhaps it is time to admit that the Latinate cauda and the ogonek
  used by Polish and other languages are different beasts.
\end{quote}
and provided an OpenType feature (\textsl{ss15}) to distinguish them
in the Junicode
font\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/issues/13}}.
I have no opinion on this matter.

The meaning of the letter with a bar above is yet to be checked in the
texts.

\section{Modification of the letter \textit{g}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-g}

\def\CAPTIONg{The variants of the letter \textit{g}}
\input g

I have very little to say about the glyphs on Fig.~\ref{fig:g}, as I
haven't found any occurence of them in a text. On one hand it resemble
the letters \textit{rum}, cf. sec. \ref{sec:modif-lett-r}, and
\textit{tum}, cf. sec. \ref{sec:modif-lett-t}. On the other hand it
resemble also the glyph from the Fig.~\ref{fig:cis}. Moreover Blake
\cite{Blake} says that \textit{weird vertical line at end of word}
means a \textit{s} preceded by a vowel (typically \textit{es} in
English and \textit{is} in Latin); in other words in Latin it can be
perhaps considered as the ligature of \textit{g} and the letter
\textit{is} discussed already in sec.~\ref{sec:non-alph-brev}.

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{h}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-h}

\def\CAPTIONh{The variants of the letter \textit{h}}
\input h

For some fonts there is an evident similarity of item on
Fig.~\ref{fig:h}, Fig.~\ref{fig:b} and Fig. ~\ref{fig:d}. It seems to
be a design decision.

The character with the almost identical shape appeared already in
Gutenberg's 42-line Bible. In MUFI recommendation it is identified as
\ucode{E8C3} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER B LIGATED WITH ARM OF LATIN}
(\Ju{}). Jacques André \cite[p.~17]{andre15:B42} notes that the name
is strange and I agree with him.

% s. 41 B42 ?

The glyphs on Fig.~\ref{fig:h} seem to be the same as those described
as \textit{h with a tick on top} by Blake, who states
\begin{quote}
  Stands for \textit{h}-syllables like \textit{han}, \textit{het}, and
  \textit{hic}
\end{quote}

Another interpretation was presented by Lisa Howarth on the Facebook
The Paleography Society
group\tbsurlfootnote{facebook.com/groups/7687162686/permalink/10158299890607687}:
\begin{quote}
  When attached to an 'h', it usually means 'er' or 'ab' depending on the word
\end{quote}
She considers the glyph to be composed from the letter \textit{h} and
an diacritical sign, similarily as Peter
Baker\tburlfootnote{{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/133}}
who identifies the diacritics as \ucode{0335} \uname{COMBINING SHORT
  STROKE OVERLAY} (\Ju{◌̵}). 

\section{The modification of the letter \textit{l}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-l}


\def\CAPTIONl{The variants of the letter \textit{l}}
\input l

Reportedly the glyphs on Fig.~\ref{fig:l} have the same meaning as
\ucode {A749} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH HIGH STROKE} (\Ju{ꝉ})
and therefore a separate code point has not been
assigned\tburlfootnote{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/issues/4}. However
the Junicode font contains at the code point \ucode{F000F} the glyph
\textit{l with high stroke ending with flourish} (\Ju{󰀏}) accessible
also as \textit{l} with the OpenType feature \textsf{ss10} and the
tags {\Ju{\&\_\_s;}}{\Ju{\&\_\_f;}}.

  \label{fig:lB42}

The character with the almost identical shape appeared already in
Gutenberg's 42-line Bible, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:lB42}.



\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{p}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-p}

\def\CAPTIONpbardes{The letter \textit{p} with stroke}
\input pbardes


Fig \ref{fig:pbardes} contains the variants of a well known brevigraphs,
which is available in Unicode since version 5.1.0 (published in 2008)
as \ucode{A751} \uname{LATIN LETTER P WITH STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER}
with the representative glyph \Ju{ꝑ}.  The brevigraph is ambiguius,
the most popular meanings are \textit{per}, \textit{par} and
\textit{por}; it can be used as an individual word or as a prefix.


\def\CAPTIONpflour{The letter \textit{p} with flourish}
\input pflour


The base characters on Fig \ref{fig:pflour} are also the variants of a
well known brevigraphs, which is available in Unicode since version
5.1.0 (published in 2008) as \ucode{A753} \uname{LATIN LETTER P WITH
  WITH FLOURISH} with the representative glyph \Ju{ꝓ}.  The brevigraph
is also ambiguous, the most popular meanings are \textit{pro} and
\textit{por}; it can be used as an individual word or as a prefix.


The last characters are included in the MUFI recommendation as
\ucode{EED7} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE PP WITH FLOURISH} with the
glyph \Ju{}, the meaning is \textit{prop-}.

The meaning of the characters with diacritics is yet to be checked in
the texts. 

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{q}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-q}


\def\CAPTIONqbardes{The letter \textit{q} with stroke through descender}
\input qbardes

The glyphs on Fig. \ref{fig:qbardes} represent a well-known
brevigraphs, which is included in Unicode since version 5.1.0
(published in 2008) as \ucode{A757} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH
  STROKE THROUGH DESCENDER} with the representative glyph \Ju{ꝗ}.  It
can be used as an individual word or as part of it and is quite
ambiguous, the reported meanings are \textit{quam}, \textit{que},
\textit{quan-} and
\hbox{\textit{qui-}}.

\def\CAPTIONqslstrok{The letter \textit{q} with diagonal stroke}
\input qslstrok

The Fig. \ref{fig:qbardes} demonstrates also various kinds of
diacritical marks which can be used with this brevigraph. The meanings
of modified brevigraphs is not clear and requires some further
research.


The characters on Fig. \ref{fig:qslstrok} are in my opinion the
variants of the brevigraph introduced to Unicode in version 5.1.0
(published 2008) as \ucode{A759} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH
  DIAGONAL STROKE} with the representative glyph \Ju{ꝙ}, although such
a classification of some shapes is questionable.  The Unicode name is
not very adequate, in \cite[p.~70]{andre22:_inven_unicod_mufi} the
name \uname{latin small letter q with swash} is proposed.  The
brevigraph has three meaning: \textit{quod}, \textit{qui} and
\textit{que}; it can be used as an individual word or as a part of it.

The meanings of modified brevigraphs with diacritical marks is not
clear. Here we will only mention that in
\cite[p.~71]{andre22:_inven_unicod_mufi} a glyph similar to those from
the Fig. \ref{fig:qslstrok} is classified as \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER
  Q WITH SWASH AND LATIN SMALL LETTER FLATTENED OPEN A ABOVE} (an
alternative name \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q WITH FLOURISH \ldots} is
also considered), and an example is given where the brevigraph means
\textit{quan-}.

\def\CAPTIONqet{The letter \textit{q} with with final \textit{et}}
\input qet

The glyphs presented on Fig.~\ref{fig:qet} represent the brevigraph
assigned a Private Use Area code \ucode{E8BF} and the name
\uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER Q LIGATED WITH FINAL ET} by MUFI in the
version 4 of the recommendation \cite[p. 81]{haugen15:_mufi1}, in the
Junicode font rendered as \Ju{}.

Finding the meaning of the brevigraph with a diacritical mark requires
some additional research. We will only note that according to
\cite{Blake} some of the glyph from Fig. \ref{fig:qet} mean
\textit{quam} or \textit{quan}.

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{r}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-r}



\def\CAPTIONrrum{The alternative glyphs of the letter \textit{rum}}
\input rrum


The first glyph on Fig.~\ref{fig:rrum} is an interesting and rather
little known character. Although this is far from obvious, it is
\ucode{A775} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER RUM} despite the fact that the
Unicode representative glyph is \cSgl{`ꝵ'}, as in Junicode we have
\Ju{ꝵ} --- the glyph practically identical to that on the figure. The
charactert was introduced to Unicode in version 5.1 (published in
2008), together with some other similar character,
cf. sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-t}. I assume the second glyph on the
figure is just a variant of the first one.

\def\CAPTIONresp{The alternative glyphs of the letter \textit{response}}
\input resp


The glyphs on Fig.~\ref{fig:resp} are ambiguous.  They can represent
\ucode{A776} \uname{LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL RUM} (\Ssgl{ꝶ}), but
they can also be interpreted as \ucode{211E} \uname{PRESCRIPTION TAKE}
(\Ju{℞}) and, last but not least, \ucode{211F} \uname{RESPONSE}
(\Ju{℞}) which in prayer books can be paired with \textit{versicle}
character, cf. sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-v}.


\section{Modifications of the letter long \textit{s}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-long-1}

\def\CAPTIONslongflour{Long \textit{s} with flourish}
\input slongflour


The glyphs on Fig.~\ref{fig:slongflour} are noted in the MUFI
recommendations as \mcode{E8B7} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S WITH
  FLOURISH}~(\Ju{}).


The glyphs on Fig.~\ref{fig:slonget} are present neither in Unicode
nor in the MUFI recommendation, but they are obviously the long
\textit{s} (\ucode{017F}) ligated with the final \textit{et}
(\ucode{A76B}). As far as I know, this ligature is available only in
the Junicode
font\tburlfootnote{https://github.com/psb1558/Junicode-font/discussions/140}
with the Historic Ligature (\textit{hlig}) feature:
\Ju{\addfontfeature{Ligatures=Historic}ſꝫ}.
%\newcommand{\hlig}[1]{{\addfontfeature{Ligatures=Historic}#1}}
Th meaning is \textit{sed}, as exemplified in \cite[example
(68)]{Rubricella2023errata}.

\def\CAPTIONslonget{Long \textit{s} with final \textit{et}}
\input slonget

\def\CAPTIONslongx{Long \textit{s} with final \textit{et}?}
\input slongx

Fig. \ref{fig:slongx} shows a problematic glyph which I'm not sure how
to interpret.


\def\CAPTIONslongb{The ligature of long \textit{s} with the letter
  \textit{b} and its modifications} \input slongb

One of the component characters of the ligatures presented on
Fig.~\ref{fig:slongb} has been already mentioned in
sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-b}. We see also the letter \textit{b} with a
dot above; the meaning of the letter, ligated or not, is yet to be
investigated.

  It is worth noting that in item 18 instead of a normal long
  \textit{s} we have a \uname{LONG FUNNY S} proposed to be included in
  the MUFI recommendation\tburlfootnote{https://mufi.info/q.php?p=mufi/chars/unichar/1048876}.
  
  \def\CAPTIONslongl{The ligature of long \textit{s} with 
   the letter \textit{l} with flourish?}
 \input slongl

 On Fig.~\ref{fig:slongl} we have a ligature which can be perhaps
 treated as a variant of MUFI \ucode{E8AF} \uname{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE
   LONG S L WITH DIAGONAL STROKE} (\Ju{}).

\section{Modifications of the letter \textit{t}}
\label{sec:modif-lett-t}

\def\CAPTIONtum{The letter \textit{tum}}
\input tum

The Fig.~\ref{fig:tum} shows the rather rare brevigraph, namely
\ucode{A777} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER TUM} with the representative
glyph \Ju{ꝷ}.  It was introduced in version 5.1 (published in 2008),
together with some related letters such as \ucode{A775} \uname{LATIN
  SMALL LETTER RUM}, cf. sec.~\ref{sec:modif-lett-r}.

\section{Modification of the letter v}
\label{sec:modif-lett-v}

\def\CAPTIONv{The letter \textit{v} with diagonal stroke} \input v

The primary interpretation of the glyphs on Fig.~\ref{fig:v} seems to
be \ucode{A75F} \uname{LATIN SMALL LETTER V WITH DIAGONAL STROKE}
(\Ju{ꝟ}) added to Unicode in version 5.1.0 (published in 2008); in
item 14 it is the other arm which is crossed.  It means \textit{ver}
or \textit{vir}.

The glyphs can stand also for \ucode{2123} \uname{VERSICLE} (\Ju{℣}),
used to mark in the prayer books the beginning of a versicle, i.e.  a
short sentence said or sung by the minister in a church service, to
which the congregation gives a response\footnote{The definition
  provided by Google in a non-linkable form.}.


\section{Final remarks}
\label{sec:final-remarks}

As it was already mentioned, the next step should be to find the
occurences of the discussed brevigraphs in the texts and in this way
to find or verify their meaning. We don't need for this the full
transcriptions of the texts.  What is sufficient for our purposes is
\textit{glyph} or \textit{character} \textit{spotting}. These tasks
are discussed in some publications, but there seems to be no tool
available directly for use. With some limitation a variant of a
workflow described earlier can be used for this purpose. The
\textsf{djvudict} can be converted to a PDF document (created of
course with \TeX{}) with enlarged glyphs which make relatively easy to
search for interesting items and to note their identifiers,
cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:page}. Additionally an \textsf{djview4poliqarp}
index can be created, which uses the shape identifier as the
searchable entry fields, cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:cis1}.  The identifiers are
not unique, nevertheless it is possible with some effort to find the
context of a shape in the document, as illustrated on the Figures
\ref{fig:page} and \ref{fig:cis1} (please note the shape
\texttt{01344}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \flushleft

  \caption{The \textsf{djvudict} output in the form of a \textsf{djview4poliqarp} index}
  \label{fig:cis1}
\end{figure}

At present my programs supporting this approach are too primitive to
be used conveniently, but I will try to improve them.  A help of
Python and QT programmers (QT was used to implement
\textsf{djview4poliqarp} and \textsf{}\textup{djview4shapes}) would be
welcomed and appreciated.
